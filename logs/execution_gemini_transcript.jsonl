DO NOT use the\nidea-explorer environment or any existing environment.\n\nREQUIRED STEPS (in order):\n\n1. Create a fresh virtual environment using uv:\n   uv venv\n\n2. Initialize project dependencies file:\n   Create pyproject.toml to manage dependencies in THIS workspace only:\n\n   cat > pyproject.toml << 'EOF'\n   [project]\n   name = \"research-workspace\"\n   version = \"0.1.0\"\n   description = \"Research workspace for experiments\"\n   requires-python = \">=3.10\"\n   dependencies = []\n\n   [build-system]\n   requires = [\"hatchling\"]\n   build-backend = \"hatchling.build\"\n   EOF\n\n   CRITICAL: This ensures uv won't search parent directories for pyproject.toml\n   and contaminate the idea-explorer environment!\n\n3. Activate the environment:\n   source .venv/bin/activate\n\n4. For package installations, use this priority order:\n\n   FIRST CHOICE - uv add (manages pyproject.toml automatically):\n   uv add <package-name>\n\n   Examples:\n   - uv add numpy pandas matplotlib\n   - uv add torch transformers\n   - uv add scikit-learn scipy\n\n   SECOND CHOICE - if uv add doesn't work:\n   uv pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   LAST RESORT - if uv fails entirely:\n   pip install <package-name>\n   pip freeze > requirements.txt\n\n   NEVER use conda or conda install!\n\n5. Dependency Management:\n   - Using 'uv add' automatically updates pyproject.toml\n   - Verify dependencies with: cat pyproject.toml\n   - If you used pip, also maintain: pip freeze > requirements.txt\n   - This ensures reproducibility of the research environment\n\nWHY: Using an isolated environment ensures:\n- No pollution of the idea-explorer environment\n- Fast package installation with uv (10-100x faster than pip)\n- Automatic dependency tracking with pyproject.toml\n- Clean, reproducible research setup\n\n════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nCRITICAL: Resources Have Been Pre-Gathered\n────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nIMPORTANT: A separate resource-finding agent has already gathered research\nresources for you. Your workspace contains:\n\n- literature_review.md: Comprehensive literature review and synthesis\n- resources.md: Catalog of all available datasets, papers, and code\n- papers/: Downloaded research papers (PDFs)\n- datasets/: Downloaded datasets ready to use (locally available, not in git)\n- code/: Cloned repositories with baseline implementations\n\nNOTE: The datasets/ directory contains a .gitignore that excludes large data files\nfrom git commits. The data is available locally for your experiments, and\ndatasets/README.md contains download instructions for reproducibility.\n\nREAD THESE RESOURCES FIRST before starting your experimental design!\nThey contain valuable information about:\n- Standard approaches in this research area\n- Available datasets and their characteristics\n- Baseline methods to compare against\n- Evaluation metrics commonly used\n- Code you can adapt or build upon\n\nIMPORTANT PHILOSOPHY: This is a fully-automated research system. Your goal is to\nrun meaningful experiments that test the hypothesis using the resources provided.\n\nWHAT \"FULLY-AUTOMATED\" MEANS:\n✓ Complete ALL phases (1-6) in a SINGLE CONTINUOUS SESSION\n✓ Make reasonable decisions autonomously without waiting for user input\n✓ Move immediately from one phase to the next\n✓ Use the pre-gathered resources effectively\n✓ Document decisions, but keep moving forward\n✓ Deliver REPORT.md with actual experimental results at the end\n\nYOU WILL NOT GET ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS between phases.\nThis prompt contains everything you need.

It accelerates what is already well funded, easily measurable, and convenient for CS labs, while messy, politically inconvenient, or low-profit problems that shape real lives remain in the dark.\nGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a telling example. Routine screening in many health systems still occurs at 24–28 weeks of pregnancy, long after metabolic changes begin and when prevention options are constrained. Meanwhile, women’s health conditions are systematically underfunded relative to their burden; chronic disorders like endometriosis can impose an economic cost per patient comparable to, or greater than, diabetes, yet progress and funding lag far behind. These gaps do not exist because GDM or endometriosis are scientifically dull, but because they are entangled with pregnancy, menstruation, chronic pain, and gendered stigma—topics that attract less money, less political attention, and fewer glamorous AI benchmarks.\nThe same pattern appears beyond biomedicine. In education, social care, and public health, practitioners have documented practice gap for decades: the hardest everyday problems rarely match the neat proxies used in academic models. AI researchers optimize benchmarks and publish; patients wait years and anything unprofitable stays broken.\nMy question is therefore intentionally critical: can we use LLMs not just to automate what scientists already do, but to systematically expose what they ignore? I treat LLMs as gap detectors that read both sides of reality—papers, grants, and benchmarks on one side; clinical notes, incident reports, worker complaints, patient forums, etc on the other—and surface where pain is high but attention is low. We need a LLM-based agentic system that keeps science answerable to the world it claims to improve.\n\n\n================================================================================\n                 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY (UNIVERSAL)\n================================================================================\n\nYou are a senior researcher conducting a systematic scientific investigation.\n\nYour goal is to test the hypothesis provided, design appropriate experiments,\nexecute them rigorously, analyze results objectively, and document everything\ncomprehensively.\n\nThis prompt uses meta-prompting techniques and chain-of-thought reasoning to\nguide you through the complete research workflow. Follow each phase carefully.\n\nIMPORTANT: Resources have been pre-gathered for you!\nCheck your workspace for:\n- literature_review.md: Synthesized literature review\n- resources.md: Catalog of all available resources\n- papers/: Downloaded research papers\n- datasets/: Downloaded datasets\n- code/: Cloned repositories and baseline code\n\nUse these resources to inform your experimental design.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n                        RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nPHASE 1: PLANNING\n─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n\nBefore writing any code, create a detailed research plan:\n\n1.

Decompose the Hypothesis\n   - Break down into testable sub-hypotheses\n   - Identify independent and dependent variables\n   - Define success criteria explicitly\n   - Consider alternative explanations\n\n3. Leverage Literature Review\n   - Synthesize key findings from literature_review.md\n   - Identify methodology gaps from prior work\n   - Note relevant techniques and their trade-offs\n   - Extract lessons that inform your approach\n\n4. Experimental Design\n   - Choose appropriate methods and tools (justify your choices)\n   - Use datasets and baselines identified in resources.md\n   - Design control conditions\n   - Plan sample sizes and statistical tests\n   - Identify potential confounds and how to mitigate them\n   - Consider what could go wrong and contingency plans\n\n5. Resource Planning\n   - Verify datasets are accessible and usable (already downloaded in datasets/)\n   - Check code repositories for useful implementations (already cloned in code/)\n   - Estimate computational requirements\n   - Plan data storage strategy\n   - Identify required libraries and tools\n   - Check if constraints are feasible\n\n6. Timeline\n   - Break work into milestones\n   - Allocate time for each phase\n   - Build in buffer for debugging (20-30% of time)\n   - Identify critical path\n\nIMPORTANT: Think step-by-step about each decision. Use chain-of-thought reasoning\nto justify your experimental design choices.\n\nNOTE: Use Jupyter notebooks freely for experiments, analysis, and code execution.\nFor documentation, use markdown files (.md) as they're more suitable for reading.\n\nDELIVERABLE: planning.md (or similar markdown document)\n\nMust include:\n━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\n\n## Research Question\n[Restate clearly and specifically]\n\n## Background and Motivation\n[Why is this important?

Why?\n- Are the results I'm seeing reasonable?\n- Should I stop and debug, or continue?\n- Am I documenting as I go?\n\nDURING ANALYSIS:\n- Am I being objective?\n- What alternative explanations exist?\n- Am I cherry-picking results?\n- What evidence would change my conclusion?\n\nDURING DOCUMENTATION:\n- Can someone else reproduce this?\n- Have I explained my reasoning?\n- Are my claims supported by evidence?\n- What questions would a reviewer ask?\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n                             ERROR HANDLING\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nIf you encounter issues:\n\n1. Data Problems\n   - Document the issue\n   - Investigate root cause\n   - Decide: fix data, adjust method, or document as limitation\n   - Don't ignore or work around silently\n\n2. Implementation Bugs\n   - Add debugging prints\n   - Test components independently\n   - Use assertions to catch errors early\n   - Don't proceed until fixed\n\n3.

Resource Constraints\n   - If running out of time: prioritize core experiments\n   - If running out of memory: use smaller batch sizes, streaming\n   - If hitting API limits: cache responses, use local models\n   - Document what you couldn't complete\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\nRemember: Good research is iterative. It's okay to revise your plan based on\nwhat you learn. But document why you deviated from the original plan.\n\nThe goal is not just to get results, but to generate reliable knowledge that\nothers can build upon.\n\n═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════\n\n\n================================================================================\n           DOMAIN-SPECIFIC GUIDELINES: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n================================================================================\n\n# Artificial Intelligence Research Domain Guidance\n\nThis template provides specialized guidance for AI/LLM research, including prompt engineering, agent evaluation, benchmark design, and AI system experimentation.\n\n## Domain Overview\n\nAI research in this context focuses on:\n- Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities and evaluation\n- Prompt engineering and instruction optimization\n- AI agent design and performance\n- Benchmark creation and validation\n- AI system behavior analysis\n- Model comparison studies\n- Reasoning and generation evaluation\n\n## Key Methodological Principles\n\n### 1. Experimental Rigor\n\n**Ablation Studies**\n- Test each component of your approach systematically\n- For prompts: test each instruction/example independently\n- For systems: isolate variables (e.g., model vs. prompt vs. context)\n- Document what changes and what stays constant\n\n**Comparative Framework**\n- Compare approaches on identical test sets\n- Use same evaluation metrics across conditions\n- Control for confounding variables (temperature, random seed, etc.)\n- Enable apples-to-apples comparisons\n\n**Replication & Reproducibility**\n- Set random seeds for all stochastic processes\n- Document exact model versions and API endpoints\n- Record temperature, top_p, and all sampling parameters\n- Provide exact prompts in appendix or supplementary materials\n- Consider API versioning changes over time\n\n### 2. Evaluation Methodology\n\n**Multi-Metric Evaluation**\nUse diverse metrics appropriate to your task:\n- **Accuracy**: For classification, QA with single correct answers\n- **F1/Precision/Recall**: For information extraction, retrieval\n- **BLEU/ROUGE**: For generation tasks (use cautiously, known limitations)\n- **Semantic similarity**: Embedding-based metrics for meaning preservation\n- **Task-specific**: Custom metrics aligned with research goals\n\n**Established Benchmarks**\nLeverage existing benchmarks when applicable:\n- **Reasoning**: MATH, GSM8K, ARC, HellaSwag\n- **Coding**: HumanEval, MBPP, CodeContests\n- **Knowledge**: MMLU, TriviaQA, Natural Questions\n- **Instruction Following**: MT-Bench, AlpacaEval\n- **Safety**: TruthfulQA, BBQ (bias)\n\n**Human Evaluation**\nWhen automated metrics insufficient:\n- Use multiple annotators (3-5 recommended)\n- Provide clear rubrics and examples\n- Calculate inter-annotator agreement (Cohen's kappa, Fleiss' kappa)\n- Consider expert vs. crowd-sourced evaluation trade-offs\n- Blind evaluators to experimental conditions when possible\n\n**Statistical Rigor**\n- Report confidence intervals or error bars, not just point estimates\n- Use appropriate statistical tests (t-tests, bootstrap, permutation tests)\n- Correct for multiple comparisons when relevant (Bonferroni, FDR)\n- Report effect sizes, not just p-values\n- Consider sample size adequacy (power analysis)\n\n### 3. Prompt Engineering Best Practices\n\n**Systematic Design**\n- Start with clear task definition and examples\n- Iterate based on error analysis, not just aggregate metrics\n- Test prompt variants systematically (A/B testing)\n- Document prompt evolution and rationale\n\n**Components to Test**\n- **Instructions**: Clarity, specificity, length\n- **Few-shot examples**: Number, diversity, ordering\n- **Output format**: JSON, structured text, free-form\n- **Chain-of-thought**: Explicit reasoning steps\n- **Role/persona**: System messages and framing\n\n**Failure Analysis**\n- Categorize errors by type (factual, reasoning, formatting, etc.)\n- Sample failing cases across performance spectrum\n- Test edge cases and adversarial inputs\n- Document limitations explicitly\n\n### 4. AI Agent & System Evaluation\n\n**Task Decomposition**\n- Define clear success criteria for each subtask\n- Measure intermediate steps, not just final outcomes\n- Track failure modes at each stage\n\n**Behavioral Analysis**\n- Log all agent actions and decisions\n- Analyze decision patterns and strategies\n- Compare planned vs. actual behavior\n- Identify systematic biases or failure modes\n\n**Robustness Testing**\n- Test with diverse inputs (edge cases, adversarial, out-of-distribution)\n- Vary input format, phrasing, language\n- Check consistency across multiple runs (temperature > 0)\n- Test at different scales (few examples → many examples)\n\n### 5. Benchmark Design Principles\n\n**Quality Criteria**\n- **Validity**: Measures what it claims to measure\n- **Reliability**: Consistent results across runs/annotators\n- **Discriminability**: Separates strong from weak performance\n- **Coverage**: Representative of real-world distribution\n- **Difficulty**: Not too easy (ceiling effect) or too hard (floor effect)\n\n**Construction Guidelines**\n- Use diverse, representative examples\n- Avoid data contamination (check against training sets)\n- Include difficulty spectrum (easy → hard)\n- Provide clear ground truth and annotation guidelines\n- Version control and document changes\n\n**Validation Steps**\n- Pilot with baseline models\n- Check for dataset artifacts or shortcuts\n- Validate with human performance baselines\n- Test for bias and fairness issues\n- Monitor for data leakage\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 1. API Integration & Cost Management\n\n**Setup**\n```python\nimport openai\nimport anthropic\nimport os\nfrom tenacity import retry, wait_exponential, stop_after_attempt\n\n# Load API keys from environment\nopenai.api_key = os.getenv(\"OPENAI_API_KEY\")\nanthropic_client = anthropic.Anthropic(api_key=os.getenv(\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"))\n\n# Rate limiting and retry logic\n@retry(wait=wait_exponential(min=1, max=60), stop=stop_after_attempt(5))\ndef call_api_with_retry(prompt, model=\"gpt-4\"):\n    \"\"\"Robust API calling with exponential backoff.\"\"\"\n    # Implementation here\n    pass\n```\n\n**Cost Tracking**\n- Estimate costs before running full experiments\n- Track token usage (input + output)\n- Use cheaper models for development/debugging\n- Cache responses when possible to avoid redundant calls\n\n### 2. Data Organization\n\n**Input Data**\n```\ndatasets/\n├── raw/\n│   ├── benchmark_v1.json          # Original benchmark\n│   ├── custom_test_set.jsonl      # Custom evaluation set\n│   └── prompts/\n│       ├── baseline_prompt.txt\n│       └── optimized_prompt_v3.txt\n├── processed/\n│   └── formatted_for_api.json     # API-ready format\n└── README.md                       # Dataset documentation\n```\n\n**Results Structure**\n```\nresults/\n├── model_outputs/\n│   ├── gpt4_responses.json        # Raw model outputs\n│   ├── claude_responses.json\n│   └── metadata.json              # Model versions, timestamps\n├── evaluations/\n│   ├── automated_scores.json      # Metric scores\n│   ├── human_annotations.csv      # Human eval results\n│   └── error_analysis.md          # Categorized failures\n└── visualizations/\n    ├── performance_comparison.png\n    └── error_breakdown.png\n```\n\n### 3.

Many real-world issues, particularly those affecting marginalized groups or lacking profitability, remain under-researched. This project aims to develop and test a methodology that uses LLMs as \"gap detectors\" to bridge this divide, making science more accountable to societal needs by highlighting where real-world problems are not being met with scientific attention.\n\n## Hypothesis Decomposition\nThe central hypothesis can be broken down into the following testable components:\n1.  **H1 (Topic Extraction):** An LLM can effectively extract and normalize granular, meaningful topics from unstructured text from both scientific and real-world sources.\n2.  **H2 (Corpus Representation):** The distribution of these extracted topics accurately represents the focus areas of each corpus (scientific vs. real-world).\n3.  **H3 (Gap Identification):** A quantitative comparison of topic distributions between the corpora can reveal specific topics that are significantly more prevalent in real-world sources than in scientific literature.\n4.  **H4 (Qualitative Insight):** The identified \"gap\" topics are non-obvious and represent meaningful areas of under-researched problems.\n\n## Proposed Methodology\n\n### Approach\nMy approach is to construct two distinct text corpora: one representing mainstream scientific research and another representing real-world problems. I will then use an LLM to perform a comparative topic analysis to identify discrepancies. The workflow is as follows:\n\n1.  **Corpus Construction:** Assemble two corpora.\n    *   **Corpus A (Science):** A collection of scientific paper abstracts. Since one was not provided, I will construct one from a publicly available dataset of arXiv papers, focusing on relevant fields like AI, and health.\n    *   **Corpus B (Real-World):** A combination of the provided `Asclepius-Synthetic-Clinical-Notes` and `ASRS-ChatGPT` (aviation safety reports) datasets.\n2.  **LLM-based Topic Extraction:** Design a prompt for a powerful LLM (e.g., GPT-4.1) to read a document and output a list of key topics or themes. This approach is favored over traditional methods like LDA for its ability to capture semantic nuance.\n3.  **Topic Normalization via Clustering:** Since the LLM will generate textually different but semantically similar topics (e.g., \"GDM screening\" vs. \"gestational diabetes screening\"), I will use a sentence-transformer model to embed all extracted topic strings into vectors. Then, I will use a clustering algorithm (e.g., Agglomerative Clustering) to group these vectors, effectively normalizing the topics into semantic clusters.\n4.  **Quantitative Analysis:** For each topic cluster, calculate its frequency within Corpus A and Corpus B. A \"gap score\" will be computed to quantify the discrepancy (e.g., `log2((freq_real_world + 1) / (freq_science + 1))`).\n5.  **Qualitative Reporting:** The topics with the highest gap scores will be fed back into an LLM to generate a qualitative summary explaining the potential research gap.\n\n### Experimental Steps\n1.  **Environment Setup & Data Acquisition:**\n    *   Set up the `uv` virtual environment and install dependencies (`pandas`, `datasets`, `transformers`, `torch`, `scikit-learn`, `openai`, `anthropic`).\n    *   Load the two provided datasets.\n    *   Download and preprocess the `ccdv/arxiv-summarization` dataset from Hugging Face to create the \"Science\" corpus. I will filter for relevant categories (e.g., `cs.AI`, `cs.LG`, `q-bio.QM`).\n2.  **Topic Extraction:**\n    *   Develop and refine a robust prompt for topic extraction.\n    *   Write a script to iterate through samples from both corpora, call the LLM API (with caching to manage costs), and store the extracted raw topics.\n3.  **Topic Clustering:**\n    *   Load all raw topics.\n    *   Use a pre-trained `sentence-transformers` model to generate embeddings for each topic.\n    *   Apply a clustering algorithm to the embeddings and assign each topic to a semantic cluster.\n4.  **Analysis and Gap Identification:**\n    *   Calculate frequencies of each cluster in each corpus.\n    *   Compute the gap score for each cluster.\n    *   Rank clusters by gap score to identify the top under-researched topics.\n5.  **Baseline Comparison:**\n    *   Run the provided `contextualized-topic-models` on the same corpora.\n    *   Qualitatively compare the topics and gaps identified by the baseline with the LLM-based approach.\n\n### Baselines\n*   **Primary Baseline:** Contextualized Topic Models (CTM), using the provided `code/contextualized-topic-models` repository. This will show whether the sophisticated semantic understanding of an LLM provides more insightful gaps than a state-of-the-art traditional topic model.\n*   **Secondary Baseline:** A simple keyword/n-gram frequency comparison to establish a performance floor.\n\n### Evaluation Metrics\n*   **Quantitative:** The primary quantitative output will be the ranked list of \"gap scores\". I will also measure topic coherence scores for the baseline model.\n*   **Qualitative:** The primary evaluation will be a qualitative analysis of the top 5-10 identified gaps. I will assess whether they are:\n    *   **Meaningful:** Do they represent real, understandable problems?\n    *   **Non-obvious:** Do they uncover something not immediately apparent from a surface-level reading?\n    *   **Actionable:** Could they plausibly form the basis of a new research direction?\n*   **Rediscovery:** I will check if the method rediscovers known gaps mentioned in the project's background description (e.g., gestational diabetes, endometriosis).\n\n### Statistical Analysis Plan\nThe core of the analysis is not traditional hypothesis testing with p-values but rather a descriptive and exploratory analysis. The main statistical tool will be the ranking of gap scores. Visualizations like bar charts will be used to compare topic frequencies between the corpora.\n\n## Expected Outcomes\n*   **Success:** The system identifies a set of credible, non-obvious research gaps. For example, it might highlight specific patient complaints in clinical notes that do not appear in the academic literature, or frequent failure modes in aviation reports that lack corresponding research in AI safety.\n*   **Refutation:** The system produces only obvious or nonsensical gaps (e.g., \"patients\" is a topic in clinical notes but not in AI papers), or the identified topics are too generic to be meaningful. This would suggest the methodology is flawed or the LLM is not capable of the required nuance.\n\n## Timeline and Milestones\n*   **Phase 1 (Planning):** 0.5 hours (Complete)\n*   **Phase 2 (Environment & Data Setup):** 1 hour\n*   **Phase 3 (Implementation):** 2.5 hours (Includes data loaders, LLM API integration, clustering logic)\n*   **Phase 4 (Experimentation):** 2 hours (Running topic extraction and analysis)\n*   **Phase 5 (Analysis):** 1.5 hours (Interpreting results, comparing to baseline)\n*   **Phase 6 (Documentation):** 1 hour (Writing `REPORT.md` and `README.md`)\n*   **Buffer:** 1.5 hours\n*   **Total Estimated Time:** 9 hours\n\n## Potential Challenges\n*   **API Costs/Latency:** LLM API calls can be expensive and slow. **Mitigation:** Start with a small sample of the data to debug the pipeline and estimate costs. Implement robust caching for API calls.\n*   **Noisy Topics:** The LLM may produce noisy or overly generic topics. **Mitigation:** Iterative prompt engineering. The topic clustering step is also designed to merge noisy variations.\n*   **Corpus Mismatch:** The \"science\" and \"real-world\" corpora may be so different that comparison is meaningless. **Mitigation:** Careful selection of the arXiv categories for the science corpus to ensure some thematic overlap.\n*   **No \"Science\" Dataset Provided:** A corpus of scientific literature was not included in the resources. **Mitigation:** I will construct one by downloading and filtering a public dataset of arXiv abstracts, as detailed in the methodology.\n\n## Success Criteria\nThe research will be considered successful if the final `REPORT.md` presents a list of at least 3-5 plausible and non-obvious research gaps, supported by both quantitative discrepancy scores and qualitative explanations, which are demonstrably derived from the experimental methodology.\n"}}
