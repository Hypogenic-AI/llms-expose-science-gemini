{"title":"Solar Energetic Particle Forecasting with Multi-Task Deep Learning: SEPNet","abstract":"Solar energetic particle (SEP) events pose severe threats to spacecraft, astronaut safety, and aviation operations, accurate SEP forecasting remains a critical challenge in space weather research due to their complex origins and highly variable propagation. In this work, we built SEPNet, an innovative multi-task neural network that jointly predicts future solar eruptive events, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and SEPs, incorporating long short-term memory and transformer architectures that capture contextual dependencies. SEPNet is a machine learning framework for SEP prediction that utilizes an extensive set of predictors, including solar flares, CMEs, and space-weather HMI active region patches (SHARP) magnetic field parameters. SEPNet is rigorously evaluated on the SEPVAL SEP dataset (whitman, 2025b), which is used to evaluate the performance of the current SEP prediction models. The performance of SEPNet is compared with classical machine learning methods and current state-of-the-art pre-eruptive SEP prediction models. The results show that SEPNet, particularly with SHARP parameters, achieves higher detection rates and skill scores while maintaining suitable for real-time space weather alert operations. Although class imbalance in the data leads to relatively high false alarm rates, SEPNet consistently outperforms reference methods and provides timely SEP forecasts, highlighting the capability of deep multi-task learning for next-generation space weather prediction.

{"title":"The Role of Risk Modeling in Advanced AI Risk Management","abstract":"Rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) systems introduce novel, uncertain, and potentially catastrophic risks. Managing these risks requires a mature risk-management infrastructure whose cornerstone is rigorous risk modeling. We conceptualize AI risk modeling as the tight integration of (i) scenario building$-$causal mapping from hazards to harms$-$and (ii) risk estimation$-$quantifying the likelihood and severity of each pathway. We review classical techniques such as Fault and Event Tree Analyses, FMEA\/FMECA, STPA and Bayesian networks, and show how they can be adapted to advanced AI. A survey of emerging academic and industry efforts reveals fragmentation: capability benchmarks, safety cases, and partial quantitative studies are valuable but insufficient when divorced from comprehensive causal scenarios. Comparing the nuclear, aviation, cybersecurity, financial, and submarine domains, we observe that every sector combines deterministic guarantees for unacceptable events with probabilistic assessments of the broader risk landscape. We argue that advanced-AI governance should adopt a similar dual approach and that verifiable, provably-safe AI architectures are urgently needed to supply deterministic evidence where current models are the result of opaque end-to-end optimization procedures rather than specified by hand. In one potential governance-ready framework, developers conduct iterative risk modeling and regulators compare the results with predefined societal risk tolerance thresholds. The paper provides both a methodological blueprint and opens a discussion on the best way to embed sound risk modeling at the heart of advanced-AI risk management."}
{"title":"Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Mixed Integer Linear Programming: Explainable Graph-Based Instance Space Analysis in Air Transportation","abstract":"This paper analyzes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to address complex optimization challenges in air transportation with explainability. The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments."}
{"title":"FOD-S2R: A FOD Dataset for Sim2Real Transfer Learning based Object Detection","abstract":"Foreign Object Debris (FOD) within aircraft fuel tanks presents critical safety hazards including fuel contamination, system malfunctions, and increased maintenance costs. Despite the severity of these risks, there is a notable lack of dedicated datasets for the complex, enclosed environments found inside fuel tanks. To bridge this gap, we present a novel dataset, FOD-S2R, composed of real and synthetic images of the FOD within a simulated aircraft fuel tank. Unlike existing datasets that focus on external or open-air environments, our dataset is the first to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the real-world FOD detection performance in confined, closed structures. The real-world subset consists of 3,114 high-resolution HD images captured in a controlled fuel tank replica, while the synthetic subset includes 3,137 images generated using Unreal Engine. The dataset is composed of various Field of views (FOV), object distances, lighting conditions, color, and object size. Prior research has demonstrated that synthetic data can reduce reliance on extensive real-world annotations and improve the generalizability of vision models. Thus, we benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection models and demonstrate that introducing synthetic data improves the detection accuracy and generalization to real-world conditions. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the model performance and narrowing the Sim2Real gap, providing a valuable foundation for developing automated FOD detection systems for aviation maintenance."}

As part of the 2025 NASA Heliolab, we present a curated, open-access dataset that integrates diverse ionospheric and heliospheric measurements into a coherent, machine learning-ready structure, designed specifically to support next-generation forecasting models and address gaps in current operational frameworks. Our workflow integrates a large selection of data sources comprising Solar Dynamic Observatory data, solar irradiance indices (F10.7), solar wind parameters (velocity and interplanetary magnetic field), geomagnetic activity indices (Kp, AE, SYM-H), and NASA JPL's Global Ionospheric Maps of Total Electron Content (GIM-TEC). We also implement geospatially sparse data such as the TEC derived from the World-Wide GNSS Receiver Network and crowdsourced Android smartphone measurements. This novel heterogeneous dataset is temporally and spatially aligned into a single, modular data structure that supports both physical and data-driven modeling. Leveraging this dataset, we train and benchmark several spatiotemporal machine learning architectures for forecasting vertical TEC under both quiet and geomagnetically active conditions. This work presents an extensive dataset and modeling pipeline that enables exploration of not only ionospheric dynamics but also broader Sun-Earth interactions, supporting both scientific inquiry and operational forecasting efforts."}
{"title":"Knots: A Large-Scale Multi-Agent Enhanced Expert-Annotated Dataset and LLM Prompt Optimization for NOTAM Semantic Parsing","abstract":"Notice to Air Missions (NOTAMs) serve as a critical channel for disseminating key flight safety information, yet their complex linguistic structures and implicit reasoning pose significant challenges for automated parsing. Existing research mainly focuses on surface-level tasks such as classification and named entity recognition, lacking deep semantic understanding. To address this gap, we propose NOTAM semantic parsing, a task emphasizing semantic inference and the integration of aviation domain knowledge to produce structured, inference-rich outputs. To support this task, we construct Knots (Knowledge and NOTAM Semantics), a high-quality dataset of 12,347 expert-annotated NOTAMs covering 194 Flight Information Regions, enhanced through a multi-agent collaborative framework for comprehensive field discovery. We systematically evaluate a wide range of prompt-engineering strategies and model-adaptation techniques, achieving substantial improvements in aviation text understanding and processing.

{"title":"NOTAM-Evolve: A Knowledge-Guided Self-Evolving Optimization Framework with LLMs for NOTAM Interpretation","abstract":"Accurate interpretation of Notices to Airmen (NOTAMs) is critical for aviation safety, yet their condensed and cryptic language poses significant challenges to both manual and automated processing. Existing automated systems are typically limited to shallow parsing, failing to extract the actionable intelligence needed for operational decisions. We formalize the complete interpretation task as deep parsing, a dual-reasoning challenge requiring both dynamic knowledge grounding (linking the NOTAM to evolving real-world aeronautical data) and schema-based inference (applying static domain rules to deduce operational status). To tackle this challenge, we propose NOTAM-Evolve, a self-evolving framework that enables a large language model (LLM) to autonomously master complex NOTAM interpretation. Leveraging a knowledge graph-enhanced retrieval module for data grounding, the framework introduces a closed-loop learning process where the LLM progressively improves from its own outputs, minimizing the need for extensive human-annotated reasoning traces. In conjunction with this framework, we introduce a new benchmark dataset of 10,000 expert-annotated NOTAMs. Our experiments demonstrate that NOTAM-Evolve achieves a 30.4% absolute accuracy improvement over the base LLM, establishing a new state of the art on the task of structured NOTAM interpretation."}
{"title":"Keys in the Weights: Transformer Authentication Using Model-Bound Latent Representations","abstract":"We introduce Model-Bound Latent Exchange (MoBLE), a decoder-binding property in Transformer autoencoders formalized as Zero-Shot Decoder Non-Transferability (ZSDN). In identity tasks using iso-architectural models trained on identical data but differing in seeds, self-decoding achieves more than 0.91 exact match and 0.98 token accuracy, while zero-shot cross-decoding collapses to chance without exact matches. This separation arises without injected secrets or adversarial training, and is corroborated by weight-space distances and attention-divergence diagnostics. We interpret ZSDN as model binding, a latent-based authentication and access-control mechanism, even when the architecture and training recipe are public: encoder's hidden state representation deterministically reveals the plaintext, yet only the correctly keyed decoder reproduces it in zero-shot. We formally define ZSDN, a decoder-binding advantage metric, and outline deployment considerations for secure artificial intelligence (AI) pipelines. Finally, we discuss learnability risks (e.g., adapter alignment) and outline mitigations. MoBLE offers a lightweight, accelerator-friendly approach to secure AI deployment in safety-critical domains, including aviation and cyber-physical systems."}

{"title":"Safety Analysis of eVTOL Operations based on STPA","abstract":"Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft are expected to be quieter and more cost-effective than helicopters, offering major economic and social benefits through improved connectivity. Their adoption will require new ground infrastructure and airspace redesign, introducing risks involving multiple stakeholders (Regulators, eVTOL operators, Air navigation service providers, Vertiport operators, OEMs, Pilots, etc.). To assess these risks for the UK airspace, systems-thinking based System Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) was conducted. To manage the large number of Unsafe Control Actions (UCAs) and requirements generated due to the complexity of the analysis, a novel extension to STPA for the prioritization of results was applied. 317 UCAs were identified in total out of which 110 high-priority UCAs were analyzed (Step-4), resulting in 377 causal factors and 432 requirements. These were prioritized to produce a targeted list of 124 distinct high-priority requirements, 56 of which were identified as gaps in existing aviation regulations, policies, or procedures.. These highlight opportunities for regulatory updates in areas such as organizational performance, certification processes, training, collision avoidance, energy management, and automation. The findings provide regulators with safety considerations that could shape new or updated regulations, compliance methods, and guidance materials for the safe deployment of eVTOLs."}
{"title":"KEO: Knowledge Extraction on OMIn via Knowledge Graphs and RAG for Safety-Critical Aviation Maintenance","abstract":"We present Knowledge Extraction on OMIn (KEO), a domain-specific knowledge extraction and reasoning framework with large language models (LLMs) in safety-critical contexts. Using the Operations and Maintenance Intelligence (OMIn) dataset, we construct a QA benchmark spanning global sensemaking and actionable maintenance tasks. KEO builds a structured Knowledge Graph (KG) and integrates it into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, enabling more coherent, dataset-wide reasoning than traditional text-chunk RAG. We evaluate locally deployable LLMs (Gemma-3, Phi-4, Mistral-Nemo) and employ stronger models (GPT-4o, Llama-3.3) as judges. Experiments show that KEO markedly improves global sensemaking by revealing patterns and system-level insights, while text-chunk RAG remains effective for fine-grained procedural tasks requiring localized retrieval. These findings underscore the promise of KG-augmented LLMs for secure, domain-specific QA and their potential in high-stakes reasoning."}
{"title":"NASP-T: A Fuzzy Neuro-Symbolic Transformer for Logic-Constrained Aviation Safety Report Classification","abstract":"Deep transformer models excel at multi-label text classification but often violate domain logic that experts consider essential, an issue of particular concern in safety-critical applications. We propose a hybrid neuro-symbolic framework that integrates Answer Set Programming (ASP) with transformer-based learning on the Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS) corpus. Domain knowledge is formalized as weighted ASP rules and validated using the Clingo solver. These rules are incorporated in two complementary ways: (i) as rule-based data augmentation, generating logically consistent synthetic samples that improve label diversity and coverage; and (ii) as a fuzzy-logic regularizer, enforcing rule satisfaction in a differentiable form during fine-tuning. This design preserves the interpretability of symbolic reasoning while leveraging the scalability of deep neural architectures. We further tune per-class thresholds and report both standard classification metrics and logic-consistency rates. Compared to a strong Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) baseline, our approach improves micro- and macro-F1 scores and achieves up to an 86% reduction in rule violations on the ASRS test set. To the best of our knowledge, this constitutes the first large-scale neuro-symbolic application to ASRS reports that unifies ASP-based reasoning, rule-driven augmentation, and differentiable transformer training for trustworthy, safety-critical NLP."}
{"title":"Deep Domain Adaptation for Turbofan Engine Remaining Useful Life Prediction: Methodologies, Evaluation and Future Trends","abstract":"Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction for turbofan engines plays a vital role in predictive maintenance, ensuring operational safety and efficiency in aviation. Although data-driven approaches using machine learning and deep learning have shown potential, they face challenges such as limited data and distribution shifts caused by varying operating conditions. Domain Adaptation (DA) has emerged as a promising solution, enabling knowledge transfer from source domains with abundant data to target domains with scarce data while mitigating distributional shifts. Given the unique properties of turbofan engines, such as complex operating conditions, high-dimensional sensor data, and slower-changing signals, it is essential to conduct a focused review of DA techniques specifically tailored to turbofan engines. To address this need, this paper provides a comprehensive review of DA solutions for turbofan engine RUL prediction, analyzing key methodologies, challenges, and recent advancements. A novel taxonomy tailored to turbofan engines is introduced, organizing approaches into methodology-based (how DA is applied), alignment-based (where distributional shifts occur due to operational variations), and problem-based (why certain adaptations are needed to address specific challenges). This taxonomy offers a multidimensional view that goes beyond traditional classifications by accounting for the distinctive characteristics of turbofan engine data and the standard process of applying DA techniques to this area. Additionally, we evaluate selected DA techniques on turbofan engine datasets, providing practical insights for practitioners and identifying key challenges. Future research directions are identified to guide the development of more effective DA techniques, advancing the state of RUL prediction for turbofan engines."}
{"title":"Hybrid Powertrain Optimization for Regional Aircraft Integrating Hydrogen Fuel Cells and Aluminum Air Batteries","abstract":"With the increasing demand for air travel and the urgency to reduce emissions, transitioning from fossil fuel-based propulsion systems is a critical step toward sustainable aviation. While batteries are widely used in urban air mobility, their long charging durations limit their feasibility for consecutive flights. Hybrid propulsion systems, which integrate fuel cells and batteries, offer a promising alternative due to their higher energy density and improved efficiency. This paper presents a novel hybrid powertrain architecture for regional aircraft, incorporating a hydrogen fuel cell, a lithium-ion battery, and an auxiliary aluminum-air battery. The proposed system is evaluated using real-world power demand data from a Cessna 208 aircraft. The hydrogen fuel cell acts as the primary power source, ensuring continuous operation, while the lithium-ion battery manages transient power fluctuations to enhance system stability. The aluminum-air battery is introduced as a high-energy emergency backup, providing extended endurance during critical situations. A mixed-integer optimization model is formulated for system sizing and power scheduling, ensuring optimal energy distribution among the power sources. Multiple operational scenarios are analyzed to evaluate system performance, particularly under emergency conditions, where power reliability is crucial. The results highlight the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed hybrid architecture in improving energy efficiency and flight safety for regional aircraft applications."}
{"title":"Implementation of airborne ML models with semantics preservation","abstract":"Machine Learning (ML) may offer new capabilities in airborne systems. However, as any piece of airborne systems, ML-based systems will be required to guarantee their safe operation. Thus, their development will have to be demonstrated to be compliant with the adequate guidance. So far, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has published a concept paper and an EUROCAE\/SAE group is preparing ED-324. Both approaches delineate high-level objectives to confirm the ML model achieves its intended function and maintains training performance in the target environment. The paper aims to clarify the difference between an ML model and its corresponding unambiguous description, referred to as the Machine Learning Model Description (MLMD). It then refines the essential notion of semantics preservation to ensure the accurate replication of the model. We apply our contributions to several industrial use cases to build and compare several target models."}
{"title":"Communications to Circulations: Real-Time 3D Wind Field Prediction Using 5G GNSS Signals and Deep Learning","abstract":"Accurate atmospheric wind field information is crucial for various applications, including weather forecasting, aviation safety, and disaster risk reduction. However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to forecast three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear, and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in real-time wind forecasts (up to 30 minutes lead time). The model exhibits robustness across forecast horizons and different pressure levels, and its predictions for wind fields show superior agreement with ground-based radar wind profiler compared to concurrent European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5). Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations (e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications."}
{"title":"In-domain SSL pre-training and streaming ASR","abstract":"In this study, we investigate the benefits of domain-specific self-supervised pre-training for both offline and streaming ASR in Air Traffic Control (ATC) environments. We train BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then fine-tune on a smaller supervised ATC set. To enable real-time processing, we propose using chunked attention and dynamic convolutions, ensuring low-latency inference. We compare these in-domain SSL models against state-of-the-art, general-purpose speech encoders such as w2v-BERT 2.0 and HuBERT. Results show that domain-adapted pre-training substantially improves performance on standard ATC benchmarks, significantly reducing word error rates when compared to models trained on broad speech corpora. Furthermore, the proposed streaming approach further improves word error rate under tighter latency constraints, making it particularly suitable for safety-critical aviation applications. These findings highlight that specializing SSL representations for ATC data is a practical path toward more accurate and efficient ASR systems in real-world operational settings."}
{"title":"Distinguishing Startle from Surprise Events Based on Physiological Signals","abstract":"Unexpected events can impair attention and delay decision-making, posing serious safety risks in high-risk environments such as aviation. In particular, reactions like startle and surprise can impact pilot performance in different ways, yet are often hard to distinguish in practice. Existing research has largely studied these reactions separately, with limited focus on their combined effects or how to differentiate them using physiological data. In this work, we address this gap by distinguishing between startle and surprise events based on physiological signals using machine learning and multi-modal fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that these events can be reliably predicted, achieving a highest mean accuracy of 85.7% with SVM and Late Fusion. To further validate the robustness of our model, we extended the evaluation to include a baseline condition, successfully differentiating between Startle, Surprise, and Baseline states with a highest mean accuracy of 74.9% with XGBoost and Late Fusion."}
{"title":"Design of Reliable and Resilient Electric Power Systems for Wide-Body All-Electric Aircraft","abstract":"To achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, all-electric transportation is a promising option. In the U.S., the transportation sector contributes the largest share (29 percent) of greenhouse gas emissions. While electric vehicles are approaching maturity, aviation is only beginning to develop electrified aircraft for commercial flights. More than 75 percent of aviation emissions come from large aircraft, and this impact will worsen with 4-5 percent annual air travel growth. Aircraft electrification has led to two types: more electric aircraft (MEA) and all-electric aircraft (AEA). A MEA replaces subsystems such as hydraulics with electric alternatives, whereas an AEA uses electrically driven subsystems and provides thrust fully from electrochemical energy units (EEUs). For wide-body AEA, thrust demand is about 25 MW plus 1 MW for non-thrust loads, creating major challenges for electric power system (EPS) design. Achieving maximum power density requires minimizing mass and volume. Increasing voltage into the kilovolt range using medium-voltage direct current (MVDC) is a feasible option to enhance power transfer. Consequently, designing an MVDC EPS for wide-body AEA is critical. Because EPS failures could jeopardize passenger safety, reliability and resilience are essential. This chapter presents a load-flow model for DC systems to determine power flows in both normal and single-contingency conditions, followed by analysis of optimal MVDC EPS architectures. A complete EPS for wide-body AEA is introduced, with EEUs and non-propulsion loads located, distances estimated, and flow studies performed. Multiple architectures are evaluated for reliability, power density, power loss, and cost to identify optimal solutions."}
{"title":"Improving Aviation Safety Analysis: Automated HFACS Classification Using Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization","abstract":"Analyzing the human factors behind aviation accidents is crucial for preventing future incidents, yet traditional methods using the Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) are limited by scalability and consistency. To address this, we introduce an automated HFACS classification framework for aviation safety analysis that utilizes Reinforcement Learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to fine-tune a Llama-3.1 8B language model. Our approach incorporates a multi-component reward system tailored for aviation safety analysis and integrates synthetic data generation to overcome class imbalance in accident datasets. The resulting GRPO-optimized model achieved noticeable performance gains, including a 350% increase in exact match accuracy (from 0.0400 to 0.1800) and an improved partial match accuracy of 0.8800. Significantly, our specialized model outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs (Large Language Models), including GPT-5-mini and Gemini-2.5-fiash, on key metrics. This research also proposes exact match accuracy in multi-label HFACS classification problem as a new benchmarking methodology to evaluate the advanced reasoning capabilities of language models. Ultimately, our work validates that smaller, domain-optimized models can provide a computationally efficient and better solution for critical safety analysis. This approach makes powerful, low-latency deployment on resource-constrained edge devices feasible."}
{"title":"A Scalable Framework for the Management of STPA Requirements: a Case Study on eVTOL Operations","abstract":"System-Theoretic Process Analysis (STPA) is a recommended method for analysing complex systems, capable of identifying thousands of safety requirements often missed by traditional techniques such as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA). However, the absence of a structured framework for managing and prioritising these requirements presents challenges, particularly in fast-paced development environments. This paper introduces a scalable framework for prioritising STPA-derived requirements. The framework integrates outputs from each STPA step and incorporates expert evaluations based on four key factors: implementation time, cost, requirement type, and regulatory coverage. To reduce subjectivity, Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) is employed to calculate and stabilise requirement rankings. An automation toolchain supports the framework, enabling dynamic mapping of prioritised requirements in a scaling matrix. This visualisation aids decision-making and ensures traceability across development phases. The framework is applicable from early conceptualisation to more advanced stages, enhancing its utility in iterative system development. The framework was validated through a real-world case study focused on Electric Vertical Take-off and Landing (eVTOL) operations, conducted in collaboration with the UK Civil Aviation Authority. The findings contributed directly to CAP3141, a Civil Aviation Publication that identifies systemic operational risks and safety mitigations for regulators, operators, and vertiports. The prioritisation process supported decision-making by helping stakeholders identify and manage high-impact requirements efficiently. This work contributes a practical solution for managing STPA outputs, bridging gaps in requirement prioritisation and supporting safety-critical development in emerging technologies."}
{"title":"A Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI Framework for Flight Continuous Descent Operations Classification","abstract":"Continuous Descent Operations (CDO) involve smooth, idle-thrust descents that avoid level-offs, reducing fuel burn, emissions, and noise while improving efficiency and passenger comfort. Despite its operational and environmental benefits, limited research has systematically examined the factors influencing CDO performance. Moreover, many existing methods in related areas, such as trajectory optimization, lack the transparency required in aviation, where explainability is critical for safety and stakeholder trust. This study addresses these gaps by proposing a Fuzzy-Enhanced Explainable AI (FEXAI) framework that integrates fuzzy logic with machine learning and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis. For this purpose, a comprehensive dataset of 29 features, including 11 operational and 18 weather-related features, was collected from 1,094 flights using Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. Machine learning models and SHAP were then applied to classify flights' CDO adherence levels and rank features by importance. The three most influential features, as identified by SHAP scores, were then used to construct a fuzzy rule-based classifier, enabling the extraction of interpretable fuzzy rules. All models achieved classification accuracies above 90%, with FEXAI providing meaningful, human-readable rules for operational users. Results indicated that the average descent rate within the arrival route, the number of descent segments, and the average change in directional heading during descent were the strongest predictors of CDO performance. The FEXAI method proposed in this study presents a novel pathway for operational decision support and could be integrated into aviation tools to enable real-time advisories that maintain CDO adherence under varying operational conditions."}
{"title":"Predictive Uncertainty for Runtime Assurance of a Real-Time Computer Vision-Based Landing System","abstract":"Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous navigation capabilities for civil aviation, including automated landing and runway detection. However, ensuring that these systems meet the robustness and safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii) a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision that can be used downstream for fault detection."}
{"title":"Remote ID Based UAV Collision Avoidance Optimization for Low-Altitude Airspace Safety","abstract":"With the rapid development of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is paramount to ensure safe and efficient operations in open airspaces. The remote identification (Remote ID) is deemed an effective real-time UAV monitoring system by the federal aviation administration, which holds potentials for enabling inter-UAV communications. This paper deeply investigates the application of Remote ID for UAV collision avoidance while minimizing communication delays. First, we propose a Remote ID based distributed multi-UAV collision avoidance (DMUCA) framework to support the collision detection, avoidance decision-making, and trajectory recovery. Next, the average transmission delays for Remote ID messages are analyzed, incorporating the packet reception mechanisms and packet loss due to interference. The optimization problem is formulated to minimize the long-term average communication delay, where UAVs can flexibly select the Remote ID protocol to enhance the collision avoidance performance. To tackle the problem, we design a multi-agent deep Q-network based adaptive communication configuration algorithm, allowing UAVs to autonomously learn the optimal protocol configurations in dynamic environments. Finally, numerical results verify the feasibility of the proposed DMUCA framework, and the proposed mechanism can reduce the average delay by 32% compared to the fixed protocol configuration."}

{"title":"Transportation Cyber Incident Awareness through Generative AI-Based Incident Analysis and Retrieval-Augmented Question-Answering Systems","abstract":"Technological advancements have revolutionized numerous industries, including transportation. While digitalization, automation, and connectivity have enhanced safety and efficiency, they have also introduced new vulnerabilities. With 95% of data breaches attributed to human error, promoting cybersecurity awareness in transportation is increasingly critical. Despite numerous cyberattacks on transportation systems worldwide, comprehensive and centralized records of these incidents remain scarce. To address this gap and enhance cyber awareness, this paper presents a large language model (LLM) based approach to extract and organize transportation related cyber incidents from publicly available datasets. A key contribution of this work is the use of generative AI to transform unstructured, heterogeneous cyber incident data into structured formats. Incidents were sourced from the Center for Strategic & International Studies (CSIS) List of Significant Cyber Incidents, the University of Maryland Cyber Events Database (UMCED), the European Repository of Cyber Incidents (EuRepoC), the Maritime Cyber Attack Database (MCAD), and the U.S. DOT Transportation Cybersecurity and Resiliency (TraCR) Examples of Cyber Attacks in Transportation (2018 to 2022). These were classified by a fine tuned LLM into five transportation modes: aviation, maritime, rail, road, and multimodal, forming a transportation specific cyber incident database. Another key contribution of this work is the development of a Retrieval Augmented Generation question answering system, designed to enhance accessibility and practical use by enabling users to query the curated database for specific details on transportation related cyber incidents. By leveraging LLMs for both data extraction and user interaction, this study contributes a novel, accessible tool for improving cybersecurity awareness in the transportation sector."}
{"title":"Enhancing Fatigue Detection through Heterogeneous Multi-Source Data Integration and Cross-Domain Modality Imputation","abstract":"Fatigue detection for human operators plays a key role in safety critical applications such as aviation, mining, and long haul transport. While numerous studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of high fidelity sensors in controlled laboratory environments, their performance often degrades when ported to real world settings due to noise, lighting conditions, and field of view constraints, thereby limiting their practicality. This paper formalizes a deployment oriented setting for real world fatigue detection, where high quality sensors are often unavailable in practical applications. To address this challenge, we propose leveraging knowledge from heterogeneous source domains, including high fidelity sensors that are difficult to deploy in the field but commonly used in controlled environments, to assist fatigue detection in the real world target domain. Building on this idea, we design a heterogeneous and multiple source fatigue detection framework that adaptively utilizes the available modalities in the target domain while exploiting diverse configurations in the source domains through alignment across domains and modality imputation. Our experiments, conducted using a field deployed sensor setup and two publicly available human fatigue datasets, demonstrate the practicality, robustness, and improved generalization of our approach across subjects and domains. The proposed method achieves consistent gains over strong baselines in sensor constrained scenarios."}
{"title":"Strategies to Manage Human Factors in Mixed Reality Pilot Training: A Survey","abstract":"Mixed Reality (MR) head mounted displays (HMDs) offer a promising alternative to traditional Flight Simulator Training Device (FSTD) displays, providing immersion, realism and cost efficiency. However, these technologies require management of human factors; cybersickness, visual fatigue and ergonomic strain. If left unmitigated, these effects can hinder pilot performance and training outcomes. For safety critical fields like aviation, addressing human factors challenges is crucial for MR's training potential. This survey systematically reviews the current literature identifying key human factors challenges in MR HMD use in pilot training and examines strategies to mitigate these barriers. Drawing on existing industry standards set by a leading aviation authority, the review adopts a regulatory perspective to explore hardware, software, ergonomic, physiological and psychological interventions improving pilot comfort, safety and training effectiveness in an MR FSTD. Additionally, it evaluates which of these interventions are most appropriate and viable for MR pilot training under existing aviation training regulations, ensuring that technical requirements and pilot wellbeing remain balanced. The findings yield significant insights for the human dimensions of aviation simulation training, highlighting how regulatory considerations shape the practicality of mitigation measures. These insights inform emerging MR aviation training guidelines and best practices, supporting MR's readiness to enhance aviation training."}
{"title":"Advances in aviation radiation mitigation were demonstrated during the Gannon storm","abstract":"A validation strategy for aviation radiation hazard mitigation has been completed using two commercial airline flights in 2024 and 2025. We review the strategy primary elements, including the emergence of aviation radiation awareness and collaborative efforts by global aviation and radiological bodies that established mitigation standards. The article highlights biological effects of radiation exposure influenced by altitude, latitude, and geomagnetic conditions, upon aircrew, frequent flyers, and commercial space travelers. It recognizes the SWAG user needs survey report that identifies the need for continuous monitoring and predictive models to ensure long-term occupational and public health safety. The ALARA strategy validation was completed using two UAL 990 flights on B777 200 aircraft between San Francisco and Paris. Each carried the same ARMAS FM7 radiation monitoring unit. One flight occurred during the Gannon storm May 10 and 11, 2024 and one flight occurred during quiet geomagnetic conditions June 8 and 9, 2025. The flight results validated the strategy during extreme space weather, i.e., apply operational controls for shielding to reduce dose. One approach is fly lower magnetic latitudes to gain more Earth magnetic field shielding and the other is fly lower altitudes to use atmosphere depth shielding. Both ALARA shielding methods are controllable in airline operations and air traffic management. This study shows the effectiveness to deviate flight paths to lower magnetic latitude routes and lower altitudes during major geomagnetic storms. Not only does this approach mitigate HF communication outages but it also reduces risks from increased GNSS errors for takeoff and landing navigation. Magnetic field shielding is a major risk reduction factor for radiation, communication, and navigation while altitude shielding reduces radiation hazard risks."}
{"title":"AeroGPT: Leveraging Large-Scale Audio Model for Aero-Engine Bearing Fault Diagnosis","abstract":"Aerospace engines, as critical components in aviation and aerospace industries, require continuous and accurate fault diagnosis to ensure operational safety and prevent catastrophic failures. While deep learning techniques have been extensively studied in this context, they output logits or confidence scores, necessitating post-processing to derive actionable insights. Furthermore, the potential of large-scale audio models in this domain remains largely untapped. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AeroGPT, a novel framework that transfers knowledge from general audio domain to aero-engine bearing fault diagnosis. AeroGPT is a framework based on large-scale audio model that incorporates Vibration Signal Alignment (VSA) to adapt general audio knowledge to domain-specific vibration patterns, and combines Generative Fault Classification (GFC) to directly output interpretable fault labels. This approach eliminates the need for post-processing of fault labels, supports interactive, interpretable, and actionable fault diagnosis, thereby greatly enhancing industrial applicability. Through comprehensive experimental validation on two aero-engine bearing datasets, AeroGPT achieved exceptional performance with 98.94% accuracy on the DIRG dataset and perfect 100% classification on the HIT bearing dataset, surpassing traditional deep learning approaches. Additional Qualitative analysis validates the effectiveness of our approach and highlights the potential of large-scale models to revolutionize fault diagnosis."}
{"title":"AviationLLM: An LLM-based Knowledge System for Aviation Training","abstract":"Aviation training is a core link in ensuring flight safety, improving industry efficiency and promoting sustainable development. It not only involves flight simulation but also requires the learning of a great deal of professional aviation theory knowledge. In the existing training system, the knowledge is mainly imparted by the the instructors. However, the number of instructors is limited and the professional answers obtained from the Internet are not accurate enough, resulting in low training efficiency. To address this, we introduced LLM, but the basic pre-trained model cannot provide accurate answers to professional fields, so we fine-tuned it. Traditional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) risk generating superficially plausible but factually incorrect responses due to insufficient data coverage. To address this, we employ Direct Preference Optimization(DPO). This paper proposes Retrieval-Augmented LLM Alignment via Direct Preference Optimization(RALA-DPO). We select open source pre-trained LLM Qwen and adapt it to aviation theory training through DPO-based domain alignment. Simultaneously, to mitigate hallucinations caused by training data biases, knowledge obsolescence, or domain knowledge gaps, we implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) technology that combines generative and retrieval models. RALA-DPO effectively retrieves relevant information from external knowledge bases and delivers precise and high-quality responses through the generative model. Experimental results demonstrate that RALA-DPO can improve accuracy in response to professional aviation knowledge. With integrated RAG mechanisms, this system can further improve the accuracy of answers and achieve zero-cost knowledge updates simultaneously."}
{"title":"A Comprehensive Review of Human Error in Risk-Informed Decision Making: Integrating Human Reliability Assessment, Artificial Intelligence, and Human Performance Models","abstract":"Human error remains a dominant risk driver in safety-critical sectors such as nuclear power, aviation, and healthcare, where seemingly minor mistakes can cascade into catastrophic outcomes. Although decades of research have produced a rich repertoire of mitigation techniques, persistent limitations: scarce high-quality data, algorithmic opacity, and residual reliance on expert judgment, continue to constrain progress. This review synthesizes recent advances at the intersection of risk-informed decision making, human reliability assessment (HRA), artificial intelligence (AI), and cognitive science to clarify how their convergence can curb human-error risk. We first categorize the principal forms of human error observed in complex sociotechnical environments and outline their quantitative impact on system reliability. Next, we examine risk-informed frameworks that embed HRA within probabilistic and data-driven methodologies, highlighting successes and gaps. We then survey cognitive and human-performance models, detailing how mechanistic accounts of perception, memory, and decision-making enrich error prediction and complement HRA metrics. Building on these foundations, we critically assess AI-enabled techniques for real-time error detection, operator-state estimation, and AI-augmented HRA workflows. Across these strands, a recurring insight emerges: integrating cognitive models with AI-based analytics inside risk-informed HRA pipelines markedly enhances predictive fidelity, yet doing so demands richer datasets, transparent algorithms, and rigorous validation. Finally, we identify promising research directions, coupling resilience engineering concepts with grounded theory, operationalizing the iceberg model of incident causation, and establishing cross-domain data consortia, to foster a multidisciplinary paradigm that elevates human reliability in high-stakes systems."}
{"title":"Is BERTopic Better than PLSA for Extracting Key Topics in Aviation Safety Reports?","abstract":"This study compares the effectiveness of BERTopic and Probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (PLSA) in extracting meaningful topics from aviation safety reports aiming to enhance the understanding of patterns in aviation incident data. Using a dataset of over 36,000 National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reports from 2000 to 2020, BERTopic employed transformer based embeddings and hierarchical clustering, while PLSA utilized probabilistic modelling through the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Results showed that BERTopic outperformed PLSA in topic coherence, achieving a Cv score of 0.41 compared to PLSA 0.37, while also demonstrating superior interpretability as validated by aviation safety experts. These findings underscore the advantages of modern transformer based approaches in analyzing complex aviation datasets, paving the way for enhanced insights and informed decision-making in aviation safety. Future work will explore hybrid models, multilingual datasets, and advanced clustering techniques to further improve topic modelling in this domain."}
{"title":"Utilizing AI for Aviation Post-Accident Analysis Classification","abstract":"The volume of textual data available in aviation safety reports presents a challenge for timely and accurate analysis. This paper examines how Artificial Intelligence (AI) and, specifically, Natural Language Processing (NLP) can automate the process of extracting valuable insights from this data, ultimately enhancing aviation safety. The paper reviews ongoing efforts focused on the application of NLP and deep learning to aviation safety reports, with the goal of classifying the level of damage to an aircraft and identifying the phase of flight during which safety occurrences happen. Additionally, the paper explores the use of Topic Modeling (TM) to uncover latent thematic structures within aviation incident reports, aiming to identify recurring patterns and potential areas for safety improvement. The paper compares and contrasts the performance of various deep learning models and TM techniques applied to datasets from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) and the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), as well as the Aviation Safety Network (ASN), discussing the impact of dataset size and source on the accuracy of the analysis. The findings demonstrate that both NLP and deep learning, as well as TM, can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of aviation safety analysis, paving the way for more proactive safety management and risk mitigation strategies."}
{"title":"SafetyNet: Detecting Harmful Outputs in LLMs by Modeling and Monitoring Deceptive Behaviors","abstract":"High-risk industries like nuclear and aviation use real-time monitoring to detect dangerous system conditions. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs) need monitoring safeguards. We propose a real-time framework to predict harmful AI outputs before they occur by using an unsupervised approach that treats normal behavior as the baseline and harmful outputs as outliers. Our study focuses specifically on backdoor-triggered responses -- where specific input phrases activate hidden vulnerabilities causing the model to generate unsafe content like violence, pornography, or hate speech. We address two key challenges: (1) identifying true causal indicators rather than surface correlations, and (2) preventing advanced models from deception -- deliberately evading monitoring systems. Hence, we approach this problem from an unsupervised lens by drawing parallels to human deception: just as humans exhibit physical indicators while lying, we investigate whether LLMs display distinct internal behavioral signatures when generating harmful content. Our study addresses two critical challenges: 1) designing monitoring systems that capture true causal indicators rather than superficial correlations; and 2)preventing intentional evasion by increasingly capable \"Future models''. Our findings show that models can produce harmful content through causal mechanisms and can become deceptive by: (a) alternating between linear and non-linear representations, and (b) modifying feature relationships. To counter this, we developed Safety-Net -- a multi-detector framework that monitors different representation dimensions, successfully detecting harmful behavior even when information is shifted across representational spaces to evade individual monitors. Our evaluation shows 96% accuracy in detecting harmful cases using our unsupervised ensemble approach."}

{"title":"From Incidents to Insights: Patterns of Responsibility following AI Harms","abstract":"The AI Incident Database was inspired by aviation safety databases, which enable collective learning from failures to prevent future incidents. The database documents hundreds of AI failures, collected from the news and media. However, criticism highlights that the AIID's reliance on media reporting limits its utility for learning about implementation failures. In this paper, we accept that the AIID falls short in its original mission, but argue that by looking beyond technically-focused learning, the dataset can provide new, highly valuable insights: specifically, opportunities to learn about patterns between developers, deployers, victims, wider society, and law-makers that emerge after AI failures. Through a three-tier mixed-methods analysis of 962 incidents and 4,743 related reports from the AIID, we examine patterns across incidents, focusing on cases with public responses tagged in the database. We identify 'typical' incidents found in the AIID, from Tesla crashes to deepfake scams.\n  Focusing on this interplay between relevant parties, we uncover patterns in accountability and social expectations of responsibility. We find that the presence of identifiable responsible parties does not necessarily lead to increased accountability. The likelihood of a response and what it amounts to depends highly on context, including who built the technology, who was harmed, and to what extent. Controversy-rich incidents provide valuable data about societal reactions, including insights into social expectations. Equally informative are cases where controversy is notably absent. This work shows that the AIID's value lies not just in preventing technical failures, but in documenting patterns of harms and of institutional response and social learning around AI incidents. These patterns offer crucial insights for understanding how society adapts to and governs emerging AI technologies."}
{"title":"Evaluating Input Modalities for Pilot-Centered Taxiway Navigation: Insights from a Wizard-of-Oz Simulation","abstract":"Runway and taxiway incursions continue to challenge aviation safety, as pilots often experience disorientation from poor visibility in adverse conditions and cognitive workload in complex airport layouts. Current tools, such as airport moving maps on portable tablets, allow manual route planning but do not dynamically adapt to air traffic controllers' (ATCOs) clearances, limiting their effectiveness in high-stress scenarios. This study investigates the impact of different input modalities - paper-based, keyboard touch, map touch, and speech-to-text - on taxiway navigation performance, using a medium-fidelity flight simulator and a Wizard-of-Oz methodology to simulate ideal automation conditions. Contrary to common assumptions, recent studies indicate that paper-based methods outperform digital counterparts in accuracy and efficiency under certain conditions, highlighting critical limitations in current automation strategies. In response, our study investigates why manual methods may excel and how future automation can be optimized for pilot-centered operations. Employing a Wizard-of-Oz approach, we replicated the full taxiing process - from receiving ATCO clearances to executing maneuvers - and differentiated between readback and execution accuracy. Findings reveal that speech-based systems suffer from low pilot trust, necessitating hybrid solutions that integrate error correction and confidence indicators. These insights contribute to the development of future pilot-centered taxiway assistance that enhance situational awareness, minimize workload, and improve overall operational safety."}
{"title":"OpenSky Report 2025: Improving Crowdsourced Flight Trajectories with ADS-C Data","abstract":"The OpenSky Network has been collecting and providing crowdsourced air traffic surveillance data since 2013. The network has primarily focused on Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Broadcast (ADS-B) data, which provides high-frequency position updates over terrestrial areas. However, the ADS-B signals are limited over oceans and remote regions, where ground-based receivers are scarce. To address these coverage gaps, the OpenSky Network has begun incorporating data from the Automatic Dependent Surveillance--Contract (ADS-C) system, which uses satellite communication to track aircraft positions over oceanic regions and remote areas. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of over 720,000 ADS-C messages collected in 2024 from around 2,600 unique aircraft via the Alphasat satellite, covering Europe, Africa, and parts of the Atlantic Ocean. We present our approach to combining ADS-B and ADS-C data to construct detailed long-haul flight paths, particularly for transatlantic and African routes. Our findings demonstrate that this integration significantly improves trajectory reconstruction accuracy, allowing for better fuel consumption and emissions estimates. We illustrate how combined data captures flight patterns across previously underrepresented regions across Africa. Despite coverage limitations, this work marks an important advancement in providing open access to global flight trajectory data, enabling new research opportunities in air traffic management, environmental impact assessment, and aviation safety."}

Current practices at many AI labs developing these systems lack sufficient transparency around safety measures, testing procedures, and governance structures. This opacity makes it challenging to verify safety claims or establish appropriate liability when harm occurs. Drawing on liability frameworks from nuclear energy, aviation software, cybersecurity, and healthcare, we propose a comprehensive approach to safety documentation and accountability in frontier AI development."}
{"title":"On Error Classification from Physiological Signals within Airborne Environment","abstract":"Human error remains a critical concern in aviation safety, contributing to 70-80% of accidents despite technological advancements. While physiological measures show promise for error detection in laboratory settings, their effectiveness in dynamic flight environments remains underexplored. Through live flight trials with nine commercial pilots, we investigated whether established error-detection approaches maintain accuracy during actual flight operations. Participants completed standardized multi-tasking scenarios across conditions ranging from laboratory settings to straight-and-level flight and 2G manoeuvres while we collected synchronized physiological data. Our findings demonstrate that EEG-based classification maintains high accuracy (87.83%) during complex flight manoeuvres, comparable to laboratory performance (89.23%). Eye-tracking showed moderate performance (82.50\\%), while ECG performed near chance level (51.50%). Classification accuracy remained stable across flight conditions, with minimal degradation during 2G manoeuvres. These results provide the first evidence that physiological error detection can translate effectively to operational aviation environments."}
{"title":"A Practical Approach to using Supervised Machine Learning Models to Classify Aviation Safety Occurrences","abstract":"This paper describes a practical approach of using supervised machine learning (ML) models to assist safety investigators to classify aviation occurrences into either incident or serious incident categories.

A selection of five supervised learning models (Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, XGBoost and K-Nearest Neighbors) were evaluated. This paper showed the best performing ML algorithm was the Random Forest Classifier with accuracy = 0.77, F1 Score = 0.78 and MCC = 0.51 (average of 100 sample runs). The study had also explored the effect of applying Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to the imbalanced dataset, and the overall observation ranged from no significant effect to substantial degradation in performance for some of the models after the SMOTE adjustment."}
{"title":"AI threats to national security can be countered through an incident regime","abstract":"Recent progress in AI capabilities has heightened concerns that AI systems could pose a threat to national security, for example, by making it easier for malicious actors to perform cyberattacks on critical national infrastructure, or through loss of control of autonomous AI systems. In parallel, federal legislators in the US have proposed nascent 'AI incident regimes' to identify and counter similar threats. In this paper, we consolidate these two trends and present a timely proposal for a legally mandated post-deployment AI incident regime that aims to counter potential national security threats from AI systems. We start the paper by introducing the concept of 'security-critical' to describe sectors that pose extreme risks to national security, before arguing that 'security-critical' describes civilian nuclear power, aviation, life science dual-use research of concern, and frontier AI development. We then present in detail our AI incident regime proposal, justifying each component of the proposal by demonstrating its similarity to US domestic incident regimes in other 'security-critical' sectors. Finally, we sketch a hypothetical scenario where our proposed AI incident regime deals with an AI cyber incident. Our proposed AI incident regime is split into three phases. The first phase revolves around a novel operationalization of what counts as an 'AI incident' and we suggest that AI providers must create a 'national security case' before deploying a frontier AI system. The second and third phases spell out that AI providers should notify a government agency about incidents, and that the government agency should be involved in amending AI providers' security and safety procedures, in order to counter future threats to national security."}

Whereas traditional factor-based trust models offer a static representation of human confidence in technology, here we discuss how variations in the underlying factors lead to variations in trust, trust thresholds, and human behaviours. Over 200 hours of flight test data collected over a multi-year test campaign from 2021 to 2023 were reviewed. The dispositional-situational-learned, process-performance-purpose, and IMPACTS homeostasis trust models are applied to illuminate trust trends during nominal autonomous flight operations. The results offer promising directions for future studies on trust dynamics and design-for-trust in human-autonomy teaming."}

{"title":"Health Prognostics in Multi-sensor Systems Based on Multivariate Functional Data Analysis","abstract":"Recent developments in big data analysis, machine learning, Industry 4.0, and IoT applications have enabled the monitoring and processing of multi-sensor data collected from systems, allowing for the prediction of the \"Remaining Useful Life\" (RUL) of system components. Particularly in the aviation industry, Prognostic Health Management (PHM) has become one of the most important practices for ensuring reliability and safety. Not only is the accuracy of RUL prediction important, but the implementability of techniques, domain adaptability, and interpretability of system degradation behaviors have also become essential. In this paper, the data collected from the multi-sensor environment of complex systems are processed using a Functional Data Analysis (FDA) approach to predict when the systems will fail and to understand and interpret the systems' life cycles. The approach is applied to the C-MAPSS datasets shared by National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the behaviors of the sensors in aircraft engine failures are adaptively modeled with Multivariate Functional Principal Component Analysis (MFPCA). While the results indicate that the proposed method predicts the RUL competitively compared to other methods in the literature, it also demonstrates how multivariate Functional Data Analysis is useful for interpretability in prognostic studies within multi-sensor environments."}

{"title":"A Frontier AI Risk Management Framework: Bridging the Gap Between Current AI Practices and Established Risk Management","abstract":"The recent development of powerful AI systems has highlighted the need for robust risk management frameworks in the AI industry. Although companies have begun to implement safety frameworks, current approaches often lack the systematic rigor found in other high-risk industries. This paper presents a comprehensive risk management framework for the development of frontier AI that bridges this gap by integrating established risk management principles with emerging AI-specific practices. The framework consists of four key components: (1) risk identification (through literature review, open-ended red-teaming, and risk modeling), (2) risk analysis and evaluation using quantitative metrics and clearly defined thresholds, (3) risk treatment through mitigation measures such as containment, deployment controls, and assurance processes, and (4) risk governance establishing clear organizational structures and accountability. Drawing from best practices in mature industries such as aviation or nuclear power, while accounting for AI's unique challenges, this framework provides AI developers with actionable guidelines for implementing robust risk management.

{"title":"Graph machine learning for flight delay prediction due to holding manouver","abstract":"Flight delays due to holding maneuvers are a critical and costly phenomenon in aviation, driven by the need to manage air traffic congestion and ensure safety. Holding maneuvers occur when aircraft are instructed to circle in designated airspace, often due to factors such as airport congestion, adverse weather, or air traffic control restrictions. This study models the prediction of flight delays due to holding maneuvers as a graph problem, leveraging advanced Graph Machine Learning (Graph ML) techniques to capture complex interdependencies in air traffic networks. Holding maneuvers, while crucial for safety, cause increased fuel usage, emissions, and passenger dissatisfaction, making accurate prediction essential for operational efficiency. Traditional machine learning models, typically using tabular data, often overlook spatial-temporal relations within air traffic data. To address this, we model the problem of predicting holding as edge feature prediction in a directed (multi)graph where we apply both CatBoost, enriched with graph features capturing network centrality and connectivity, and Graph Attention Networks (GATs), which excel in relational data contexts. Our results indicate that CatBoost outperforms GAT in this imbalanced dataset, effectively predicting holding events and offering interpretability through graph-based feature importance. Additionally, we discuss the model's potential operational impact through a web-based tool that allows users to simulate real-time delay predictions. This research underscores the viability of graph-based approaches for predictive analysis in aviation, with implications for enhancing fuel efficiency, reducing delays, and improving passenger experience."}

While system safety has emerged as a distinct discipline for a long time, originated from safety concerns in early aircraft manufacturing. The safety assurance is now an indispensable component in safety critical domains. Motivated by the assurance approaches for safety-critical systems such as aviation, this paper introduces the concept of AI ethics assurance cases into the AI ethics assurance. Three pillars of user requirements, evidence, and validation are proposed as key components and integrated into AI ethics assurance cases for a new approach of user requirements-oriented AI ethics assurance. The user requirements-oriented AI ethics assurance case is set up based on three pillars and hazard analysis methods used in the safety assurance of safety-critical systems.

{"title":"Runway vs. Taxiway: Challenges in Automated Line Identification and Notation Approaches","abstract":"The increasing complexity of autonomous systems has amplified the need for accurate and reliable labeling of runway and taxiway markings to ensure operational safety. Precise detection and labeling of these markings are critical for tasks such as navigation, landing assistance, and ground control automation. Existing labeling algorithms, like the Automated Line Identification and Notation Algorithm (ALINA), have demonstrated success in identifying taxiway markings but encounter significant challenges when applied to runway markings. This limitation arises due to notable differences in line characteristics, environmental context, and interference from elements such as shadows, tire marks, and varying surface conditions. To address these challenges, we modified ALINA by adjusting color thresholds and refining region of interest (ROI) selection to better suit runway-specific contexts. While these modifications yielded limited improvements, the algorithm still struggled with consistent runway identification, often mislabeling elements such as the horizon or non-relevant background features. This highlighted the need for a more robust solution capable of adapting to diverse visual interferences. In this paper, we propose integrating a classification step using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named AssistNet. By incorporating this classification step, the detection pipeline becomes more resilient to environmental variations and misclassifications. This work not only identifies the challenges but also outlines solutions, paving the way for improved automated labeling techniques essential for autonomous aviation systems."}
{"title":"Approach Towards Semi-Automated Certification for Low Criticality ML-Enabled Airborne Applications","abstract":"As Machine Learning (ML) makes its way into aviation, ML enabled systems including low criticality systems require a reliable certification process to ensure safety and performance. Traditional standards, like DO 178C, which are used for critical software in aviation, do not fully cover the unique aspects of ML. This paper proposes a semi automated certification approach, specifically for low criticality ML systems, focusing on data and model validation, resilience assessment, and usability assurance while integrating manual and automated processes. Key aspects include structured classification to guide certification rigor on system attributes, an Assurance Profile that consolidates evaluation outcomes into a confidence measure the ML component, and methodologies for integrating human oversight into certification activities. Through a case study with a YOLOv8 based object detection system designed to classify military and civilian vehicles in real time for reconnaissance and surveillance aircraft, we show how this approach supports the certification of ML systems in low criticality airborne applications."}
{"title":"Network Slice-based Low-Altitude Intelligent Network for Advanced Air Mobility","abstract":"Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is transforming transportation systems by extending them into near-ground airspace, offering innovative solutions to mobility challenges. In this space, electric vertical take-off and landing vehicles (eVTOLs) perform a variety of tasks to improve aviation safety and efficiency, such as collaborative computing and perception. However, eVTOLs face constraints such as compacted shape and restricted onboard computing resources. These limitations necessitate task offloading to nearby high-performance base stations (BSs) for timely processing. Unfortunately, the high mobility of eVTOLs, coupled with their restricted flight airlines and heterogeneous resource management creates significant challenges in dynamic task offloading. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel network slice-based Low-Altitude Intelligent Network (LAIN) framework for eVTOL tasks. By leveraging advanced network slicing technologies from 5G\/6G, the proposed framework dynamically adjusts communication bandwidth, beam alignment, and computing resources to meet fluctuating task demands. Specifically, the framework includes an access pairing method to pre-schedule optimal eVTOL-BS-slice assignments, a pre-assessment algorithm to avoid resource waste, and a deep reinforcement learning-based slice orchestration mechanism to optimize resource allocation and lifecycle management. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing benchmarks in terms of resource allocation efficiency and operational\/violation costs across varying eVTOL velocities.

{"title":"The Reliability of Remotely Piloted Aircraft System Performance under Communication Loss and Latency Uncertainties","abstract":"Mission-critical use of highly maneuverable Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) requires a thorough understanding of the reliability of their communication systems. Investigations into system-level performance under stochastic aviation communication conditions are critical for estimating mission success rates and assessing the risks associated with integrating RPAS into existing airspace, ensuring overall aviation safety. This study aims to quantify the impact of communication latency and complete signal loss on the mission completion performance of a highly maneuverable RPAS. The mission is defined as a static waypoint tracking task in three-dimensional airspace. We start with examining and deriving mathematical formulations of key reliability metrics of Required Communication Performance (RCP). These stochastic factors are then embedded into flight control simulations (i.e., communication availability and latency) to examine the system behavior. Lastly, we generate mission success rate and mission completion time envelopes through extensive multiprocessing Monte Carlo simulations through high-performance computing. We discover a drastic deterioration in flight performance while latency or availability erodes the stability margin. In addition, we propose a new reliability metric, namely \\textit{communicability}, which integrates three key RCP metrics and helps understanding the maximum tolerable latency to flight control. The procedure and results obtained from this research inform engineers designing RPAS with better trade-off between communication capability and flight control performance. Future works includes exploring alternative flight simulators (i.e., nonlinear dynamic inversion) with other missions (i.e., dynamic waypoint following), or develop delay-compensated optimal controls. The analysis on stability margin is also desired for theoretical verification."}

{"title":"Ultra-reliable urban air mobility networks","abstract":"Recently, urban air mobility (UAM) has attracted attention as an emerging technology that will bring innovation to urban transportation and aviation systems. Since the UAM systems pursue fully autonomous flight without a pilot, wireless communication is a key function not only for flight control signals, but also for navigation and safety information. The essential information is called a command and control (C2) message, and the UAM networks must be configured so that the UAM can receive the C2 message by securing a continuous link stability without any interruptions. Nevertheless, a lot of prior works have focused only on improving the average performance without solving the low-reliability in the cell edges and coverage holes of urban areas. In this dissertation, we identify the factors that hinder the communication link reliability in considering three-dimensional (3D) urban environments, and propose a antenna configuration, resource utilization, and transmission strategy to enable UAM receiving C2 messages regardless of time and space. First, through stochastic geometry modeling, we analyze the signal blockage effects caused by the urban buildings. The blockage probability is calculated according to the shape, height, and density of the buildings, and the coverage probability of the received signal is derived by reflecting the blockage events. Furthermore, the low-reliability area is identified by analyzing the coverage performance according to the positions of the UAMs. To overcome the low-reliability region, we propose three methods for UAM network operation: i) optimization of antennas elevation tilting, ii) frequency reuse with multi-layered narrow beam, and iii) assistive transmissions by the master UAM."}

We open-source tools to process this data into clean tabular position reports. We release Amelia42-Mini, a 15-day sample per airport, fully processed data on HuggingFace for ease of use. We also present a trajectory forecasting benchmark consisting of Amelia10-Bench, an accessible experiment family using 292 days from 10 airports, as well as Amelia-TF, a transformer-based baseline for multi-agent trajectory forecasting. All resources are available at our website: https:\/\/ameliacmu.github.io and https:\/\/huggingface.co\/AmeliaCMU."}
{"title":"Obfuscated Location Disclosure for Remote ID Enabled Drones","abstract":"The Remote ID (RID) regulation recently introduced by several aviation authorities worldwide (including the US and EU) forces commercial drones to regularly (max. every second) broadcast plaintext messages on the wireless channel, providing information about the drone identifier and current location, among others. Although these regulations increase the accountability of drone operations and improve traffic management, they allow malicious users to track drones via the disclosed information, possibly leading to drone capture and severe privacy leaks. In this paper, we propose Obfuscated Location disclOsure for RID-enabled drones (OLO-RID), a solution modifying and extending the RID regulation while preserving drones' location privacy. Rather than disclosing the actual drone's location, drones equipped with OLO-RID disclose a differentially private obfuscated location in a mobile scenario. OLO-RID also extends RID messages with encrypted location information, accessible only by authorized entities and valuable to obtain the current drone's location in safety-critical use cases. We design, implement, and deploy OLO-RID on a Raspberry Pi 3 and release the code of our implementation as open-source. We also perform an extensive performance assessment of the runtime overhead of our solution in terms of processing, communication, memory, and energy consumption. We show that OLO-RID can generate RID messages on a constrained device in less than 0.16 s while also requiring a minimal energy toll on a relevant device (0.0236% of energy for a DJI Mini 2). We also evaluate the utility of the proposed approach in the context of three reference use cases involving the drones' location usage, demonstrating minimal performance degradation when trading off location privacy and utility for next-generation RID-compliant drone ecosystems."}
{"title":"Fusion Flow-enhanced Graph Pooling Residual Networks for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Surveillance in Day and Night Dual Visions","abstract":"Recognizing unauthorized Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within designated no-fly zones throughout the day and night is of paramount importance, where the unauthorized UAVs pose a substantial threat to both civil and military aviation safety. However, recognizing UAVs day and night with dual-vision cameras is nontrivial, since red-green-blue (RGB) images suffer from a low detection rate under an insufficient light condition, such as on cloudy or stormy days, while black-and-white infrared (IR) images struggle to capture UAVs that overlap with the background at night. In this paper, we propose a new optical flow-assisted graph-pooling residual network (OF-GPRN), which significantly enhances the UAV detection rate in day and night dual visions. The proposed OF-GPRN develops a new optical fusion to remove superfluous backgrounds, which improves RGB\/IR imaging clarity. Furthermore, OF-GPRN extends optical fusion by incorporating a graph residual split attention network and a feature pyramid, which refines the perception of UAVs, leading to a higher success rate in UAV detection. A comprehensive performance evaluation is conducted using a benchmark UAV catch dataset. The results indicate that the proposed OF-GPRN elevates the UAV mean average precision (mAP) detection rate to 87.8%, marking a 17.9% advancement compared to the residual graph neural network (ResGCN)-based approach."}
{"title":"An Open-source Hardware\/Software Architecture and Supporting Simulation Environment to Perform Human FPV Flight Demonstrations for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Autonomy","abstract":"Small multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), mainly quadcopters, are nowadays ubiquitous in research on aerial autonomy, including serving as scaled-down models for much larger aircraft such as vertical-take-off-and-lift vehicles for urban air mobility. Among the various research use cases, first-person-view RC flight experiments allow for collecting data on how human pilots fly such aircraft, which could then be used to compare, contrast, validate, or train autonomous flight agents. While this could be uniquely beneficial, especially for studying UAV operation in contextually complex and safety-critical environments such as in human-UAV shared spaces, the lack of inexpensive and open-source hardware\/software platforms that offer this capability along with low-level access to the underlying control software and data remains limited. To address this gap and significantly reduce barriers to human-guided autonomy research with UAVs, this paper presents an open-source software architecture implemented with an inexpensive in-house built quadcopter platform based on the F450 Quadcopter Frame. This setup uses two cameras to provide a dual-view FPV and an open-source flight controller, Pixhawk. The underlying software architecture, developed using the Python-based Kivy library, allows logging telemetry, GPS, control inputs, and camera frame data in a synchronized manner on the ground station computer. Since costs (time) and weather constraints typically limit numbers of physical outdoor flight experiments, this paper also presents a unique AirSim\/Unreal Engine based simulation environment and graphical user interface aka digital twin, that provides a Hardware In The Loop setup via the Pixhawk flight controller. We demonstrate the usability and reliability of the overall framework through a set of diverse physical FPV flight experiments and corresponding flight tests in the digital twin."}
{"title":"Tradeoffs When Considering Deep Reinforcement Learning for Contingency Management in Advanced Air Mobility","abstract":"Air transportation is undergoing a rapid evolution globally with the introduction of Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) and with it comes novel challenges and opportunities for transforming aviation. As AAM operations introduce increasing heterogeneity in vehicle capabilities and density, increased levels of automation are likely necessary to achieve operational safety and efficiency goals. This paper focuses on one example where increased automation has been suggested. Autonomous operations will need contingency management systems that can monitor evolving risk across a span of interrelated (or interdependent) hazards and, if necessary, execute appropriate control interventions via supervised or automated decision making. Accommodating this complex environment may require automated functions (autonomy) that apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques that can adapt and respond to a quickly changing environment. This paper explores the use of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) which has shown promising performance in complex and high-dimensional environments where the objective can be constructed as a sequential decision-making problem. An extension of a prior formulation of the contingency management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is presented and uses a DRL framework to train agents that mitigate hazards present in the simulation environment. A comparison of these learning-based agents and classical techniques is presented in terms of their performance, verification difficulties, and development process."}
{"title":"Advancing Airport Tower Command Recognition: Integrating Squeeze-and-Excitation and Broadcasted Residual Learning","abstract":"Accurate recognition of aviation commands is vital for flight safety and efficiency, as pilots must follow air traffic control instructions precisely. This paper addresses challenges in speech command recognition, such as noisy environments and limited computational resources, by advancing keyword spotting technology. We create a dataset of standardized airport tower commands, including routine and emergency instructions. We enhance broadcasted residual learning with squeeze-and-excitation and time-frame frequency-wise squeeze-and-excitation techniques, resulting in our BC-SENet model. This model focuses on crucial information with fewer parameters. Our tests on five keyword spotting models, including BC-SENet, demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our model advancements in improving speech command recognition for aviation safety and efficiency in noisy, high-stakes environments. Additionally, BC-SENet shows comparable performance on the common Google Speech Command dataset."}
{"title":"Research on Dangerous Flight Weather Prediction based on Machine Learning","abstract":"With the continuous expansion of the scale of air transport, the demand for aviation meteorological support also continues to grow. The impact of hazardous weather on flight safety is critical. How to effectively use meteorological data to improve the early warning capability of flight dangerous weather and ensure the safe flight of aircraft is the primary task of aviation meteorological services. In this work, support vector machine (SVM) models are used to predict hazardous flight weather, especially for meteorological conditions with high uncertainty such as storms and turbulence. SVM is a supervised learning method that distinguishes between different classes of data by finding optimal decision boundaries in a high-dimensional space. In order to meet the needs of this study, we chose the radial basis function (RBF) as the kernel function, which helps to deal with nonlinear problems and enables the model to better capture complex meteorological data structures. During the model training phase, we used historical meteorological observations from multiple weather stations, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, and other meteorological indicators closely related to flight safety. From this data, the SVM model learns how to distinguish between normal and dangerous flight weather conditions."}

The system executes both static and dynamic calculations, the former being completely dependent, while the latter completely independent to the user's inputs. The solution is adapted to a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with CFM56-7B engines. However, the calculations also apply for similar aicrafts, equipped with a tricycle landing gear and turbofan engines.

{"title":"Global Clipper: Enhancing Safety and Reliability of Transformer-based Object Detection Models","abstract":"As transformer-based object detection models progress, their impact in critical sectors like autonomous vehicles and aviation is expected to grow. Soft errors causing bit flips during inference have significantly impacted DNN performance, altering predictions. Traditional range restriction solutions for CNNs fall short for transformers. This study introduces the Global Clipper and Global Hybrid Clipper, effective mitigation strategies specifically designed for transformer-based models. It significantly enhances their resilience to soft errors and reduces faulty inferences to ~ 0\\%. We also detail extensive testing across over 64 scenarios involving two transformer models (DINO-DETR and Lite-DETR) and two CNN models (YOLOv3 and SSD) using three datasets, totalling approximately 3.3 million inferences, to assess model robustness comprehensively. Moreover, the paper explores unique aspects of attention blocks in transformers and their operational differences from CNNs."}
{"title":"Reconciling Safety Measurement and Dynamic Assurance","abstract":"We propose a new framework to facilitate dynamic assurance within a safety case approach by associating safety performance measurement with the core assurance artifacts of a safety case. The focus is mainly on the safety architecture, whose underlying risk assessment model gives the concrete link from safety measurement to operational risk. Using an aviation domain example of autonomous taxiing, we describe our approach to derive safety indicators and revise the risk assessment based on safety measurement. We then outline a notion of consistency between a collection of safety indicators and the safety case, as a formal basis for implementing the proposed framework in our tool, AdvoCATE."}
{"title":"System Safety Monitoring of Learned Components Using Temporal Metric Forecasting","abstract":"In learning-enabled autonomous systems, safety monitoring of learned components is crucial to ensure their outputs do not lead to system safety violations, given the operational context of the system. However, developing a safety monitor for practical deployment in real-world applications is challenging. This is due to limited access to internal workings and training data of the learned component. Furthermore, safety monitors should predict safety violations with low latency, while consuming a reasonable amount of computation. To address the challenges, we propose a safety monitoring method based on probabilistic time series forecasting. Given the learned component outputs and an operational context, we empirically investigate different Deep Learning (DL)-based probabilistic forecasting to predict the objective measure capturing the satisfaction or violation of a safety requirement (safety metric). We empirically evaluate safety metric and violation prediction accuracy, and inference latency and resource usage of four state-of-the-art models, with varying horizons, using autonomous aviation and autonomous driving case studies. Our results suggest that probabilistic forecasting of safety metrics, given learned component outputs and scenarios, is effective for safety monitoring. Furthermore, for both case studies, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) was the most accurate model for predicting imminent safety violations, with acceptable latency and resource consumption."}
{"title":"Three-Dimension Collision-Free Trajectory Planning of UAVs Based on ADS-B Information in Low-Altitude Urban Airspace","abstract":"The environment of low-altitude urban airspace is complex and variable due to numerous obstacles, non-cooperative aircrafts, and birds. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) leveraging environmental information to achieve three-dimension collision-free trajectory planning is the prerequisite to ensure airspace security. However, the timely information of surrounding situation is difficult to acquire by UAVs, which further brings security risks. As a mature technology leveraged in traditional civil aviation, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) realizes continuous surveillance of the information of aircrafts. Consequently, we leverage ADS-B for surveillance and information broadcasting, and divide the aerial airspace into multiple sub-airspaces to improve flight safety in UAV trajectory planning. In detail, we propose the secure sub-airspaces planning (SSP) algorithm and particle swarm optimization rapidly-exploring random trees (PSO-RRT) algorithm for the UAV trajectory planning in law-altitude airspace. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations and the results show that SSP reduces both the maximum number of UAVs in the sub-airspace and the length of the trajectory, and PSO-RRT reduces the cost of UAV trajectory in the sub-airspace."}
{"title":"The Necessity of AI Audit Standards Boards","abstract":"Auditing of AI systems is a promising way to understand and manage ethical problems and societal risks associated with contemporary AI systems, as well as some anticipated future risks. Efforts to develop standards for auditing Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have therefore understandably gained momentum. However, we argue that creating auditing standards is not just insufficient, but actively harmful by proliferating unheeded and inconsistent standards, especially in light of the rapid evolution and ethical and safety challenges of AI. Instead, the paper proposes the establishment of an AI Audit Standards Board, responsible for developing and updating auditing methods and standards in line with the evolving nature of AI technologies. Such a body would ensure that auditing practices remain relevant, robust, and responsive to the rapid advancements in AI. The paper argues that such a governance structure would also be helpful for maintaining public trust in AI and for promoting a culture of safety and ethical responsibility within the AI industry.\n  Throughout the paper, we draw parallels with other industries, including safety-critical industries like aviation and nuclear energy, as well as more prosaic ones such as financial accounting and pharmaceuticals. AI auditing should emulate those fields, and extend beyond technical assessments to include ethical considerations and stakeholder engagement, but we explain that this is not enough; emulating other fields' governance mechanisms for these processes, and for audit standards creation, is a necessity. We also emphasize the importance of auditing the entire development process of AI systems, not just the final products..."}
{"title":"Airbus A32x vs Boeing 737 Safety Occurrences","abstract":"Safety is the priority for airlines. Airlines are sensitive to passengers' perceptions of safety, having randomly assigned the Boeing 737 Max to routes and times. Historically, Boeing has been considered more reliable and safer than Airbus. Hence, it is worth asking the question, are there any differences in the safety occurrences of the core narrow-body single-aisle aircraft of Boeing and Airbus; the 737 and A32x families of aircraft. Utilizing the International Civil Aviation Organization safety occurrence data, from 2008 to 2019, these aircraft were compared in terms of occurrence type, occurrence category, phase of flight, injury level, and fatalities. It was found that Boeing had more accidents than expected, while Airbus had less (p=0.015). In terms of fatalities Boeing has had more than expected, with Airbus less (p<0.001). Looking at just accidents, only the number of fatalities was statistically significantly different. In both cases, the increased number of fatalities for Boeing appears to be the result of the two recent Boeing 737 Max accidents. Looking at the reported fatal and hull loss accident rates, it was also found that the annual reduction for the Airbus A32x aircraft were better than for the Boeing 737 aircraft."}
{"title":"Hierarchical Multi-label Classification for Fine-level Event Extraction from Aviation Accident Reports","abstract":"A large volume of accident reports is recorded in the aviation domain, which greatly values improving aviation safety. To better use those reports, we need to understand the most important events or impact factors according to the accident reports. However, the increasing number of accident reports requires large efforts from domain experts to label those reports. In order to make the labeling process more efficient, many researchers have started developing algorithms to identify the underlying events from accident reports automatically. This article argues that we can identify the events more accurately by leveraging the event taxonomy. More specifically, we consider the problem a hierarchical classification task where we first identify the coarse-level information and then predict the fine-level information. We achieve this hierarchical classification process by incorporating a novel hierarchical attention module into BERT. To further utilize the information from event taxonomy, we regularize the proposed model according to the relationship and distribution among labels. The effectiveness of our framework is evaluated with the data collected by National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It has been shown that fine-level prediction accuracy is highly improved, and the regularization term can be beneficial to the rare event identification problem."}
{"title":"Virtual Co-Pilot: Multimodal Large Language Model-enabled Quick-access Procedures for Single Pilot Operations","abstract":"Advancements in technology, pilot shortages, and cost pressures are driving a trend towards single-pilot and even remote operations in aviation. Considering the extensive workload and huge risks associated with single-pilot operations, the development of a Virtual Co-Pilot (V-CoP) is expected to be a potential way to ensure aviation safety. This study proposes a V-CoP concept and explores how humans and virtual assistants can effectively collaborate. A preliminary case study is conducted to explore a critical role of V-CoP, namely automated quick procedures searching, using the multimodal large language model (LLM). The LLM-enabled V-CoP integrates the pilot instruction and real-time cockpit instrumental data to prompt applicable aviation manuals and operation procedures. The results showed that the LLM-enabled V-CoP achieved high accuracy in situational analysis and effective retrieval of procedure information. The results showed that the LLM-enabled V-CoP achieved high accuracy in situational analysis (90.5%) and effective retrieval of procedure information (86.5%). The proposed V-CoP is expected to provide a foundation for future virtual intelligent assistant development, improve the performance of single pilots, and reduce the risk of human errors in aviation."}
{"title":"Enhancing Space Situational Awareness to Mitigate Risk: A Single-Case Study in the Misidentification of a Recently-Launched Starlink Satellite Train as a UAP in Commercial Aviation","abstract":"Over the past several years, the misidentification of SpaceX Starlink satellites as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) by pilots and laypersons has generated unnecessary aviation risk and confusion. The many deployment and orbital evolution strategies, coupled with changing sun specular reflection angles, contribute to this gap in space situational awareness. In this paper we present a case analysis of an incident that generated multiple, corroborating reports of a UAP from five pilots on two commercial airline flights over the Pacific Ocean on August 10th, 2022. This incident included two cell phone photos and a video of an unrecognizable and possibly anomalous phenomenon. We then use supplemental two-line elements (TLEs) for the Starlink train of satellites launched that same day and Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) data from the flight with the photographs to reconstruct a view of these satellites from the cockpit at the time and place of the sighting. The success of this work demonstrates an approach that could, in principle, warn aviators about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations, thus increasing space situational awareness and supporting aviation safety. We conclude with recommendations for governments and satellite operators to provide better a-priori data that can be used to create advisories to aviators and the public. The automated simulation of known specular reflection off constellations of satellites could also support researchers investigating sightings of unfamiliar aerial or aerospace objects as likely being from normal versus novel space events."}
{"title":"Towards a Framework for Deep Learning Certification in Safety-Critical Applications Using Inherently Safe Design and Run-Time Error Detection","abstract":"Although an ever-growing number of applications employ deep learning based systems for prediction, decision-making, or state estimation, almost no certification processes have been established that would allow such systems to be deployed in safety-critical applications. In this work we consider real-world problems arising in aviation and other safety-critical areas, and investigate their requirements for a certified model. To this end, we investigate methodologies from the machine learning research community aimed towards verifying robustness and reliability of deep learning systems, and evaluate these methodologies with regard to their applicability to real-world problems. Then, we establish a new framework towards deep learning certification based on (i) inherently safe design, and (ii) run-time error detection. Using a concrete use case from aviation, we show how deep learning models can recover disentangled variables through the use of weakly-supervised representation learning. We argue that such a system design is inherently less prone to common model failures, and can be verified to encode underlying mechanisms governing the data. Then, we investigate four techniques related to the run-time safety of a model, namely (i) uncertainty quantification, (ii) out-of-distribution detection, (iii) feature collapse, and (iv) adversarial attacks. We evaluate each for their applicability and formulate a set of desiderata that a certified model should fulfill. Finally, we propose a novel model structure that exhibits all desired properties discussed in this work, and is able to make regression and uncertainty predictions, as well as detect out-of-distribution inputs, while requiring no regression labels to train. We conclude with a discussion of the current state and expected future progress of deep learning certification, and its industrial and social implications."}
{"title":"Topic Modeling Analysis of Aviation Accident Reports: A Comparative Study between LDA and NMF Models","abstract":"Aviation safety is paramount in the modern world, with a continuous commitment to reducing accidents and improving safety standards. Central to this endeavor is the analysis of aviation accident reports, rich textual resources that hold insights into the causes and contributing factors behind aviation mishaps. This paper compares two prominent topic modeling techniques, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF), in the context of aviation accident report analysis. The study leverages the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) Dataset with the primary objective of automating and streamlining the process of identifying latent themes and patterns within accident reports. The Coherence Value (C_v) metric was used to evaluate the quality of generated topics. LDA demonstrates higher topic coherence, indicating stronger semantic relevance among words within topics. At the same time, NMF excelled in producing distinct and granular topics, enabling a more focused analysis of specific aspects of aviation accidents."}
{"title":"Minimally Supervised Topological Projections of Self-Organizing Maps for Phase of Flight Identification","abstract":"Identifying phases of flight is important in the field of general aviation, as knowing which phase of flight data is collected from aircraft flight data recorders can aid in the more effective detection of safety or hazardous events. General aviation flight data for phase of flight identification is usually per-second data, comes on a large scale, and is class imbalanced. It is expensive to manually label the data and training classification models usually faces class imbalance problems. This work investigates the use of a novel method for minimally supervised self-organizing maps (MS-SOMs) which utilize nearest neighbor majority votes in the SOM U-matrix for class estimation. Results show that the proposed method can reach or exceed a naive SOM approach which utilized a full data file of labeled data, with only 30 labeled datapoints per class. Additionally, the minimally supervised SOM is significantly more robust to the class imbalance of the phase of flight data. These results highlight how little data is required for effective phase of flight identification."}
{"title":"Extending the aircraft flight envelope by mitigating transonic airfoil buffet","abstract":"In the age of globalization, commercial aviation plays a central role in maintaining our international connectivity by providing fast air transport services for passengers and freight. However, the upper limit of the aircraft flight envelope, i.e., its operational limit in the high-speed regime, is usually fixed by the occurrence of an aerodynamic phenomenon called transonic airfoil buffet. It refers to shock wave oscillations occurring on the aircraft wings, which induce unsteady aerodynamic loads acting on the wing structure. Since these loads can cause severe structural damage endangering flight safety, the aviation industry is highly interested in suppressing transonic airfoil buffet to extend the flight envelope to higher aircraft speeds. In this contribution, we demonstrate experimentally that the application of porous trailing edges substantially attenuates the buffet phenomenon. Since porous trailing edges have the additional benefit of reducing acoustic aircraft emissions, our findings could pave the way for faster air transport with reduced noise emissions."}
{"title":"Towards Engineering Fair and Equitable Software Systems for Managing Low-Altitude Airspace Authorizations","abstract":"Small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) have gained widespread adoption across a diverse range of applications. This has introduced operational complexities within shared airspaces and an increase in reported incidents, raising safety concerns. In response, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is developing a UAS Traffic Management (UTM) system to control access to airspace based on an sUAS's predicted ability to safely complete its mission. However, a fully automated system capable of swiftly approving or denying flight requests can be prone to bias and must consider safety, transparency, and fairness to diverse stakeholders. In this paper, we present an initial study that explores stakeholders' perspectives on factors that should be considered in an automated system. Results indicate flight characteristics and environmental conditions were perceived as most important but pilot and drone capabilities should also be considered. Further, several respondents indicated an aversion to any AI-supported automation, highlighting the need for full transparency in automated decision-making. Results provide a societal perspective on the challenges of automating UTM flight authorization decisions and help frame the ongoing design of a solution acceptable to the broader sUAS community."}
{"title":"Robustness Assessment of a Runway Object Classifier for Safe Aircraft Taxiing","abstract":"As deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming the prominent solution for many computational problems, the aviation industry seeks to explore their potential in alleviating pilot workload and in improving operational safety. However, the use of DNNs in this type of safety-critical applications requires a thorough certification process. This need can be addressed through formal verification, which provides rigorous assurances -- e.g.,~by proving the absence of certain mispredictions. In this case-study paper, we demonstrate this process using an image-classifier DNN currently under development at Airbus and intended for use during the aircraft taxiing phase. We use formal methods to assess this DNN's robustness to three common image perturbation types: noise, brightness and contrast, and some of their combinations. This process entails multiple invocations of the underlying verifier, which might be computationally expensive; and we therefore propose a method that leverages the monotonicity of these robustness properties, as well as the results of past verification queries, in order to reduce the overall number of verification queries required by nearly 60%. Our results provide an indication of the level of robustness achieved by the DNN classifier under study, and indicate that it is considerably more vulnerable to noise than to brightness or contrast perturbations."}
{"title":"CABBA: Compatible Authenticated Bandwidth-efficient Broadcast protocol for ADS-B","abstract":"The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is a surveillance technology that mandated in many airspaces. It improves safety, increases efficiency and reduces air traffic congestion by broadcasting aircraft navigation data. Yet, ADS-B is vulnerable to spoofing attacks as it lacks mechanisms to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the data being supplied. None of the existing cryptographic solutions fully meet the backward compatibility and bandwidth preservation requirements of the standard. Hence, we propose the Compatible Authenticated Bandwidth-efficient Broadcast protocol for ADS-B (CABBA), an improved approach that integrates TESLA, phase-overlay modulation techniques and certificate-based PKI. As a result, entity authentication, data origin authentication, and data integrity are the security services that CABBA offers. To assess compliance with the standard, we designed an SDR-based implementation of CABBA and performed backward compatibility tests on commercial and general aviation (GA) ADS-B in receivers. Besides, we calculated the 1090ES band's activity factor and analyzed the channel occupancy rate according to ITU-R SM.2256-1 recommendation. Also, we performed a bit error rate analysis of CABBA messages. The results suggest that CABBA is backward compatible, does not incur significant communication overhead, and has an error rate that is acceptable for Eb\/No values above 14 dB."}
{"title":"Validation of Collision Detection and Avoidance Methods for Urban Air Mobility through Simulation","abstract":"Urban Air Mobility is a new concept of regional aviation that has been growing in popularity as a solution to the issue of ever-increasing ground traffic. Electric vehicles with vertical take-off and landing capabilities are being developed by numerous market companies as a result of the push toward environmentally sustainable aviation. The next stage in the eVTOL development process would be to define the concept of operation of these conceptual aircraft and then to integrate them with the existing airspace once they are airborne. In addition to coordinating with conventional air traffic and other Urban Air Mobility (UAM) vehicles, collision avoidance with uncooperative airspace users has to be addressed. Birds and drones of all sizes could be dangerous for these low-flying aircraft. Innovative collision detection and avoidance techniques need to be employed due to the uncooperative nature of these airspace users and different performance characteristics of urban air mobility vehicles compared to classical fixed-wing aircraft. The aim of this study is to validate one such system by means of fast-time solutions. This system uses a decision tree and safety envelopes to prevent collisions with non-cooperative airspace members. The system is designed to work with different aircraft configurations used for Urban Air Mobility (UAM) operations. Various scenarios are modelled by varying intruder type, location, flight path among others. Changes in flight time and closest point of approach are assessed to evaluate the system with regard to safety and efficiency."}
{"title":"AviationGPT: A Large Language Model for the Aviation Domain","abstract":"The advent of ChatGPT and GPT-4 has captivated the world with large language models (LLMs), demonstrating exceptional performance in question-answering, summarization, and content generation. The aviation industry is characterized by an abundance of complex, unstructured text data, replete with technical jargon and specialized terminology. Moreover, labeled data for model building are scarce in this domain, resulting in low usage of aviation text data. The emergence of LLMs presents an opportunity to transform this situation, but there is a lack of LLMs specifically designed for the aviation domain. To address this gap, we propose AviationGPT, which is built on open-source LLaMA-2 and Mistral architectures and continuously trained on a wealth of carefully curated aviation datasets. Experimental results reveal that AviationGPT offers users multiple advantages, including the versatility to tackle diverse natural language processing (NLP) problems (e.g., question-answering, summarization, document writing, information extraction, report querying, data cleaning, and interactive data exploration). It also provides accurate and contextually relevant responses within the aviation domain and significantly improves performance (e.g., over a 40% performance gain in tested cases). With AviationGPT, the aviation industry is better equipped to address more complex research problems and enhance the efficiency and safety of National Airspace System (NAS) operations."}
{"title":"Vertiport Navigation Requirements and Multisensor Architecture Considerations for Urban Air Mobility","abstract":"Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) technologies are key enablers for future safe operation of drones in urban environments. However, the design of navigation technologies for these new applications is more challenging compared to e.g., civil aviation. On the one hand, the use cases and operations in urban environments are expected to have stringent requirements in terms of accuracy, integrity, continuity and availability. On the other hand, airborne sensors may not be based on high-quality equipment as in civil aviation and solutions need to rely on tighter multisensor solutions, whose safety is difficult to assess. In this work, we first provide some initial navigation requirements related to precision approach operations based on recently proposed vertiport designs. Then, we provide an overview of a possible multisensor navigation architecture solution able to support these types of operations and we comment on the challenges of each of the subsystems. Finally, initial proof of concept for some navigation sensor subsystems is presented based on flight trials performed during the German Aerospace Center (DLR) project HorizonUAM."}
{"title":"Autonomous Advanced Aerial Mobility -- An End-to-end Autonomy Framework for UAVs and Beyond","abstract":"Developing aerial robots that can both safely navigate and execute assigned mission without any human intervention - i.e., fully autonomous aerial mobility of passengers and goods - is the larger vision that guides the research, design, and development efforts in the aerial autonomy space. However, it is highly challenging to concurrently operationalize all types of aerial vehicles that are operating fully autonomously sharing the airspace. Full autonomy of the aerial transportation sector includes several aspects, such as design of the technology that powers the vehicles, operations of multi-agent fleets, and process of certification that meets stringent safety requirements of aviation sector. Thereby, Autonomous Advanced Aerial Mobility is still a vague term and its consequences for researchers and professionals are ambiguous. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive perspective on the emerging field of autonomous advanced aerial mobility, which involves the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft for various applications, such as urban air mobility, package delivery, and surveillance. The article proposes a scalable and extensible autonomy framework consisting of four main blocks: sensing, perception, planning, and controls. Furthermore, the article discusses the challenges and opportunities in multi-agent fleet operations and management, as well as the testing, validation, and certification aspects of autonomous aerial systems. Finally, the article explores the potential of monolithic models for aerial autonomy and analyzes their advantages and limitations. The perspective aims to provide a holistic picture of the autonomous advanced aerial mobility field and its future directions."}
{"title":"Parametric model for post-processing visibility ensemble forecasts","abstract":"Although by now the ensemble-based probabilistic forecasting is the most advanced approach to weather prediction, ensemble forecasts still might suffer from lack of calibration and\/or display systematic bias, thus require some post-processing to improve their forecast skill. Here we focus on visibility, which quantity plays a crucial role e.g. in aviation and road safety or in ship navigation, and propose a parametric model where the predictive distribution is a mixture of a gamma and a truncated normal distribution, both right censored at the maximal reported visibility value. The new model is evaluated in two case studies based on visibility ensemble forecasts of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts covering two distinct domains in Central and Western Europe and two different time periods. The results of the case studies indicate that post-processed forecasts are substantially superior to the raw ensemble; moreover, the proposed mixture model consistently outperforms the Bayesian model averaging approach used as reference post-processing technique."}

Therefore, a conceptual design method was developed that provides a structured approach for designing the safe multirotor propulsion architecture. Based on the concept of operation the powertrain system was initially predefined, iteratively refined based on the safety assessment and validated through component sizing and simulations. The analysis was conducted within three system groups that were developed in parallel: the drivetrain, the energy supply and the thermal management system. The design process indicated that a pure quadcopter propulsion system can merely be designed reasonably for meeting the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) reliability specifications. By adding two push propellers and implementing numerous safety as well as passivation measures the reliability specifications defined by EASA could finally be fulfilled. The subsequent system simulations also verified that the system architecture is capable of meeting the requirements of the vehicle concept of operations. However, further work is required to extend the safety analysis to additional system components as the thermal management system or the battery management system and to reduce propulsion system weight."}
{"title":"Towards Robust and Efficient Communications for Urban Air Mobility","abstract":"For the realization of the future urban air mobility, reliable information exchange based on robust and efficient communication between all airspace participants will be one of the key factors to ensure safe operations. Especially in dense urban scenarios, the direct and fast information exchange between drones based on Drone-to-Drone communications is a promising technology for enabling reliable collision avoidance systems. However, to mitigate collisions and to increase overall reliability, unmanned aircraft still lack a redundant, higher-level safety net to coordinate and monitor traffic, as is common in today's civil aviation. In addition, direct and fast information exchange based on ad hoc communication is needed to cope with the very short reaction times required to avoid collisions and to cope with the the high traffic densities. Therefore, we are developing a \\ac{d2d} communication and surveillance system, called DroneCAST, which is specifically tailored to the requirements of a future urban airspace and will be part of a multi-link approach. In this work we discuss challenges and expected safety-critical applications that will have to rely on communications for \\ac{uam} and present our communication concept and necessary steps towards DroneCAST. As a first step towards an implementation, we equipped two drones with hardware prototypes of the experimental communication system and performed several flights around the model city to evaluate the performance of the hardware and to demonstrate different applications that will rely on robust and efficient communications."}
{"title":"International Governance of Civilian AI: A Jurisdictional Certification Approach","abstract":"This report describes trade-offs in the design of international governance arrangements for civilian artificial intelligence (AI) and presents one approach in detail. This approach represents the extension of a standards, licensing, and liability regime to the global level. We propose that states establish an International AI Organization (IAIO) to certify state jurisdictions (not firms or AI projects) for compliance with international oversight standards. States can give force to these international standards by adopting regulations prohibiting the import of goods whose supply chains embody AI from non-IAIO-certified jurisdictions. This borrows attributes from models of existing international organizations, such as the International Civilian Aviation Organization (ICAO), the International Maritime Organization (IMO), and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). States can also adopt multilateral controls on the export of AI product inputs, such as specialized hardware, to non-certified jurisdictions. Indeed, both the import and export standards could be required for certification. As international actors reach consensus on risks of and minimum standards for advanced AI, a jurisdictional certification regime could mitigate a broad range of potential harms, including threats to public safety."}

{"title":"KITLM: Domain-Specific Knowledge InTegration into Language Models for Question Answering","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in a wide range of natural language tasks. However, as these models continue to grow in size, they face significant challenges in terms of computational costs. Additionally, LLMs often lack efficient domain-specific understanding, which is particularly crucial in specialized fields such as aviation and healthcare. To boost the domain-specific understanding, we propose, KITLM, a novel knowledge base integration approach into language model through relevant information infusion. By integrating pertinent knowledge, not only the performance of the language model is greatly enhanced, but the model size requirement is also significantly reduced while achieving comparable performance. Our proposed knowledge-infused model surpasses the performance of both GPT-3.5-turbo and the state-of-the-art knowledge infusion method, SKILL, achieving over 1.5 times improvement in exact match scores on the MetaQA. KITLM showed a similar performance boost in the aviation domain with AeroQA. The drastic performance improvement of KITLM over the existing methods can be attributed to the infusion of relevant knowledge while mitigating noise. In addition, we release two curated datasets to accelerate knowledge infusion research in specialized fields: a) AeroQA, a new benchmark dataset designed for multi-hop question-answering within the aviation domain, and b) Aviation Corpus, a dataset constructed from unstructured text extracted from the National Transportation Safety Board reports. Our research contributes to advancing the field of domain-specific language understanding and showcases the potential of knowledge infusion techniques in improving the performance of language models on question-answering."}

{"title":"Air Traffic Controller Workload Level Prediction using Conformalized Dynamical Graph Learning","abstract":"Air traffic control (ATC) is a safety-critical service system that demands constant attention from ground air traffic controllers (ATCos) to maintain daily aviation operations. The workload of the ATCos can have negative effects on operational safety and airspace usage. To avoid overloading and ensure an acceptable workload level for the ATCos, it is important to predict the ATCos' workload accurately for mitigation actions. In this paper, we first perform a review of research on ATCo workload, mostly from the air traffic perspective. Then, we briefly introduce the setup of the human-in-the-loop (HITL) simulations with retired ATCos, where the air traffic data and workload labels are obtained. The simulations are conducted under three Phoenix approach scenarios while the human ATCos are requested to self-evaluate their workload ratings (i.e., low-1 to high-7). Preliminary data analysis is conducted. Next, we propose a graph-based deep-learning framework with conformal prediction to identify the ATCo workload levels. The number of aircraft under the controller's control varies both spatially and temporally, resulting in dynamically evolving graphs. The experiment results suggest that (a) besides the traffic density feature, the traffic conflict feature contributes to the workload prediction capabilities (i.e., minimum horizontal\/vertical separation distance); (b) directly learning from the spatiotemporal graph layout of airspace with graph neural network can achieve higher prediction accuracy, compare to hand-crafted traffic complexity features; (c) conformal prediction is a valuable tool to further boost model prediction accuracy, resulting a range of predicted workload labels.

{"title":"Learning Constrained Corner Node Trajectories of a Tether Net System for Space Debris Capture","abstract":"The earth's orbit is becoming increasingly crowded with debris that poses significant safety risks to the operation of existing and new spacecraft and satellites. The active tether-net system, which consists of a flexible net with maneuverable corner nodes launched from a small autonomous spacecraft, is a promising solution for capturing and disposing of such space debris. The requirement of autonomous operation and the need to generalize over scenarios with debris scenarios in different rotational rates makes the capture process significantly challenging. The space debris could rotate about multiple axes, which, along with sensing\/estimation and actuation uncertainties, calls for a robust, generalizable approach to guiding the net launch and flight - one that can guarantee robust capture. This paper proposes a decentralized actuation system combined with reinforcement learning for planning and controlling this tether-net system. In this new system, four microsatellites with cold gas type thrusters act as the corner nodes of the net and can thus help control or correct the flight of the net after launch. The microsatellites pull the net to complete the task of approaching and capturing the space debris. The proposed method uses a RL framework that integrates a proximal policy optimization to find the optimal solution based on the dynamics simulation of the net and the microsatellites performed in Vortex Studio. The RL framework finds the optimal trajectory that is both fuel-efficient and ensures a desired level of capture quality."}
{"title":"Impact of UAVs Equipped with ADS-B on the Civil Aviation Monitoring System","abstract":"In recent years, there is an increasing demand for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to complete multiple applications. However, as unmanned equipments, UAVs lead to some security risks to general civil aviations. In order to strengthen the flight management of UAVs and guarantee the safety, UAVs can be equipped with automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) devices. In addition, as an automatic system, ADS-B can periodically broadcast flight information to the nearby aircrafts or the ground stations, and the technology is already used in civil aviation systems. However, due to the limited frequency of ADS-B technique, UAVs equipped with ADS-B devices result in the loss of packets to both UAVs and civil aviation. Further, the operation of civil aviation are seriously interfered. Hence, this paper firstly examines the packets loss of civil planes at different distance, then analyzes the impact of UAVs equipped with ADS-B on the packets updating of civil planes. The result indicates that the 1090MHz band blocking is affected by the density of UAVs. Besides, the frequency capacity is affected by the requirement of updating interval of civil planes. The position updating probability within 3s is 92.3% if there are 200 planes within 50km and 20 UAVs within 5km. The position updating probability within 3s is 86.9% if there are 200 planes within 50km and 40 UAVs within 5km."}
{"title":"Deep Ensemble for Rotorcraft Attitude Prediction","abstract":"Historically, the rotorcraft community has experienced a higher fatal accident rate than other aviation segments, including commercial and general aviation. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and the application of these technologies in different areas of our lives are both intriguing and encouraging. When developed appropriately for the aviation domain, AI techniques provide an opportunity to help design systems that can address rotorcraft safety challenges. Our recent work demonstrated that AI algorithms could use video data from onboard cameras and correctly identify different flight parameters from cockpit gauges, e.g., indicated airspeed. These AI-based techniques provide a potentially cost-effective solution, especially for small helicopter operators, to record the flight state information and perform post-flight analyses. We also showed that carefully designed and trained AI systems could accurately predict rotorcraft attitude (i.e., pitch and yaw) from outside scenes (images or video data). Ordinary off-the-shelf video cameras were installed inside the rotorcraft cockpit to record the outside scene, including the horizon. The AI algorithm could correctly identify rotorcraft attitude at an accuracy in the range of 80\\%. In this work, we combined five different onboard camera viewpoints to improve attitude prediction accuracy to 94\\%. In this paper, five onboard camera views included the pilot windshield, co-pilot windshield, pilot Electronic Flight Instrument System (EFIS) display, co-pilot EFIS display, and the attitude indicator gauge. Using video data from each camera view, we trained various convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which achieved prediction accuracy in the range of 79\\% % to 90\\% %. We subsequently ensembled the learned knowledge from all CNNs and achieved an ensembled accuracy of 93.3\\%."}
{"title":"Estimating See and Be Seen Performance with an Airborne Visual Acquisition Model","abstract":"Separation provision and collision avoidance to avoid other air traffic are fundamental components of the layered conflict management system to ensure safe and efficient operations. Pilots have visual-based separation responsibilities to see and be seen to maintain separation between aircraft. To safely integrate into the airspace, drones should be required to have a minimum level of performance based on the safety achieved as baselined by crewed aircraft seen and be seen interactions. Drone interactions with crewed aircraft should not be more hazardous than interactions between traditional aviation aircraft. Accordingly, there is need for a methodology to design and evaluate detect and avoid systems, to be equipped by drones to mitigate the risk of a midair collision, where the methodology explicitly addresses, both semantically and mathematically, the appropriate operating rules associated with see and be seen. In response, we simulated how onboard pilots safely operate through see and be seen interactions using an updated visual acquisition model that was originally developed by J.W. Andrews decades ago. Monte Carlo simulations were representative two aircraft flying under visual flight rules and results were analyzed with respect to drone detect and avoid performance standards."}
{"title":"Risk-aware Urban Air Mobility Network Design with Overflow Redundancy","abstract":"Urban air mobility (UAM), as envisioned by aviation professionals, will transport passengers and cargo at low altitudes within urban and suburban areas. To operate in urban environments, precise air traffic management, in particular the management of traffic overflows due to physical and operational disruptions will be critical to ensuring system safety and efficiency. To this end, we propose UAM network design with reserve capacity, i.e., a design where alternative landing options and flight corridors are explicitly considered as a means of improving contingency management. Similar redundancy considerations are incorporated in the design of many critical infrastructures, yet remain unexploited in the air transportation literature. In our methodology, we first model how disruptions to a given UAM network might impact on the nominal traffic flow and how this flow might be re-accommodated on an extended network with reserve capacity. Then, through an optimization problem, we select the locations and capacities for the backup vertiports with the maximal expected throughput of the extended network over all possible disruption scenarios, while the throughput is the maximal amount of flights that the network can accommodate per unit of time. We show that we can obtain the solution for the corresponding bi-level and bi-linear optimization problem by solving a mixed-integer linear program. We demonstrate our methodology in the case study using networks from Milwaukee, Atlanta, and Dallas--Fort Worth metropolitan areas and show how the throughput and flexibility of the UAM networks with reserve capacity can outcompete those without."}
{"title":"Integrated Conflict Management for UAM with Strategic Demand Capacity Balancing and Learning-based Tactical Deconfliction","abstract":"Urban air mobility (UAM) has the potential to revolutionize our daily transportation, offering rapid and efficient deliveries of passengers and cargo between dedicated locations within and around the urban environment. Before the commercialization and adoption of this emerging transportation mode, however, aviation safety must be guaranteed, i.e., all the aircraft have to be safely separated by strategic and tactical deconfliction. Reinforcement learning has demonstrated effectiveness in the tactical deconfliction of en route commercial air traffic in simulation. However, its performance is found to be dependent on the traffic density. In this project, we propose a novel framework that combines demand capacity balancing (DCB) for strategic conflict management and reinforcement learning for tactical separation. By using DCB to precondition traffic to proper density levels, we show that reinforcement learning can achieve much better performance for tactical safety separation. Our results also indicate that this DCB preconditioning can allow target levels of safety to be met that are otherwise impossible. In addition, combining strategic DCB with reinforcement learning for tactical separation can meet these safety levels while achieving greater operational efficiency than alternative solutions."}
{"title":"A LSTM and Cost-Sensitive Learning-Based Real-Time Warning for Civil Aviation Over-limit","abstract":"The issue of over-limit during passenger aircraft flights has drawn increasing attention in civil aviation due to its potential safety risks. To address this issue, real-time automated warning systems are essential. In this study, a real-time warning model for civil aviation over-limit is proposed based on QAR data monitoring. Firstly, highly correlated attributes to over-limit are extracted from a vast QAR dataset using the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Because flight over-limit poses a binary classification problem with unbalanced samples, this paper incorporates cost-sensitive learning in the LSTM model. Finally, the time step length, number of LSTM cells, and learning rate in the LSTM model are optimized using a grid search approach. The model is trained on a real dataset, and its performance is evaluated on a validation set. The experimental results show that the proposed model achieves an F1 score of 0.991 and an accuracy of 0.978, indicating its effectiveness in real-time warning of civil aviation over-limit."}
{"title":"Uncertainty Quantification in Machine Learning for Engineering Design and Health Prognostics: A Tutorial","abstract":"On top of machine learning models, uncertainty quantification (UQ) functions as an essential layer of safety assurance that could lead to more principled decision making by enabling sound risk assessment and management. The safety and reliability improvement of ML models empowered by UQ has the potential to significantly facilitate the broad adoption of ML solutions in high-stakes decision settings, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and aviation, to name a few. In this tutorial, we aim to provide a holistic lens on emerging UQ methods for ML models with a particular focus on neural networks and the applications of these UQ methods in tackling engineering design as well as prognostics and health management problems. Toward this goal, we start with a comprehensive classification of uncertainty types, sources, and causes pertaining to UQ of ML models. Next, we provide a tutorial-style description of several state-of-the-art UQ methods: Gaussian process regression, Bayesian neural network, neural network ensemble, and deterministic UQ methods focusing on spectral-normalized neural Gaussian process. Established upon the mathematical formulations, we subsequently examine the soundness of these UQ methods quantitatively and qualitatively (by a toy regression example) to examine their strengths and shortcomings from different dimensions. Then, we review quantitative metrics commonly used to assess the quality of predictive uncertainty in classification and regression problems. Afterward, we discuss the increasingly important role of UQ of ML models in solving challenging problems in engineering design and health prognostics. Two case studies with source codes available on GitHub are used to demonstrate these UQ methods and compare their performance in the life prediction of lithium-ion batteries at the early stage and the remaining useful life prediction of turbofan engines."}
{"title":"Fault Tolerant Processing Unit Using Gamma Distribution Sliding Window For Autonomous Landing Guidance System","abstract":"To keep up with today's dense metropolitan areas and their accompanying traffic problems, a growing number of towns are looking for more advanced and swift urban taxi drones. The safety parameters that must be taken into consideration may be the most important element in the widespread use of such technology. Most recent aviation mishaps have happened during the landing phase, making this a particularly important safety consideration for Vertical and\/or Short Take-Off and Landing (V\/STOL) drones. In this study, we focused on improving the fault tolerance of the processor architectures used by the predecessors of Autonomous Landing Guidance Assistance Systems (ALGAS), which in turn improves their decision-making capabilities. Furthermore, this is achieved by proposing a fault-tolerant processing architecture that depends on the Gamma Distribution Sliding Window Unit (GDSWU). This proposed GDSWU has been designed completely using VHDL, and the targeted FPFA was the Intel Cyclone V 5CGXFC9D6F27C7 chip. The GDSWU could operate at a maximum frequency of 369.96 MHz, as calculated by the synthesis results of the INTEL Quartus Prime program. The suggested GDSWU core only requires 20.36 mW for dynamic core and I\/O power consumption."}
{"title":"Integrating spoken instructions into flight trajectory prediction to optimize automation in air traffic control","abstract":"The booming air transportation industry inevitably burdens air traffic controllers' workload, causing unexpected human factor-related incidents. Current air traffic control systems fail to consider spoken instructions for traffic prediction, bringing significant challenges in detecting human errors during real-time traffic operations. Here, we present an automation paradigm integrating controlling intent into the information processing loop through the spoken instruction-aware flight trajectory prediction framework. A 3-stage progressive multi-modal learning paradigm is proposed to address the modality gap between the trajectory and spoken instructions, as well as minimize the data requirements. Experiments on a real-world dataset show the proposed framework achieves flight trajectory prediction with high predictability and timeliness, obtaining over 20% relative reduction in mean deviation error. Moreover, the generalizability of the proposed framework is also confirmed by various model architectures. The proposed framework can formulate full-automated information processing in real-world air traffic applications, supporting human error detection and enhancing aviation safety."}

John Garrick Institute for the Risk Sciences at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA-GIRS) and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU). IWASS is an invitation-only event designed to be a platform for cross-industrial and interdisciplinary effort and knowledge exchange on autonomous systems' Safety, Reliability, and Security (SRS). The workshop gathers experts from academia, regulatory agencies, and industry to discuss challenges and potential solutions for SRS of autonomous systems from different perspectives. It complements existing events organized around specific types of autonomous systems (e.g., cars, ships, aviation) or particular safety or security-related aspects of such systems (e.g., cyber risk, software reliability, etc.). IWASS distinguishes itself from these events by addressing these topics together and proposing solutions for SRS challenges common to different types of autonomous systems. IWASS 2022 was held on August 28th in Dublin, Ireland, and gathered 30 participants from 20 organizations from around the globe. In addition, a panel session at the European Safety and Reliability Conference (ESREL 2023) discussed the workshop's main conclusions and additional points with a larger audience.

{"title":"Securing Autonomous Air Traffic Management: Blockchain Networks Driven by Explainable AI","abstract":"Air Traffic Management data systems today are inefficient and not scalable to enable future unmanned systems. Current data is fragmented, siloed, and not easily accessible. There is data conflict, misuse, and eroding levels of trust in provenance and accuracy. With increased autonomy in aviation, Artificially Intelligent (AI) enabled unmanned traffic management (UTM) will be more reliant on secure data from diverse stakeholders. There is an urgent need to develop a secure network that has trustworthy data chains and works with the requirements generated by UTM. Here, we review existing research in 3 key interconnected areas: (1) blockchain development for secure data transfer between competing aviation stakeholders, (2) self-learning networking architectures that distribute consensus to achieve secure air traffic control, (3) explainable AI to build trust with human stakeholders and backpropagate requirements for blockchain and network optimisation. When connected together, this new digital ecosystem blueprint is tailored for safety critical UTM sectors. We motivate the readers with a case study, where a federated learning UTM uses real air traffic and weather data is secured and explained to human operators. This emerging area still requires significant research and development by the community to ensure it can enable future autonomous air mobility."}
{"title":"PFL: a Probabilistic Logic for Fault Trees","abstract":"Safety-critical infrastructures must operate in a safe and reliable way. Fault tree analysis is a widespread method used for risk assessment of these systems: fault trees (FTs) are required by, e.g., the Federal Aviation Administration and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. In spite of their popularity, little work has been done on formulating structural queries about FT and analyzing these, e.g., when evaluating potential scenarios, and to give practitioners instruments to formulate queries on FTs in an understandable yet powerful way. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by extending BFL [32], a logic that reasons about Boolean FTs. To do so, we introduce a Probabilistic Fault tree Logic (PFL). PFL is a simple, yet expressive logic that supports easier formulation of complex scenarios and specification of FT properties that comprise probabilities. Alongside PFL, we present LangPFL, a domain specific language to further ease property specification. We showcase PFL and LangPFL by applying them to a COVID-19 related FT and to a FT for an oil\/gas pipeline. Finally, we present theory and model checking algorithms based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs)."}

Preparation of SORA requires expert knowledge as it contains technicalities. Also, the whole process is an iterative and time-consuming one. It is even more challenging for higher-risk operations, such as those in urban environments, near airports, and multi- and customized models for research activities. SORA process limits the potential socio-economic impacts of innovative UAV capabilities. Therefore, in this paper, we present a SORA example, review the steps and highlight challenges. Accordingly, we propose an alternative workflow, considering the same steps, while addressing the challenges and pitfalls, to shorten the whole process. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive list of preliminary technical procedures, including the pre\/during\/post-flight checklists, design and installation appraisal, flight logbook, operational manual, training manual, and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which are not explicitly instructed in SORA manual. Moreover, we propose the initial idea to create an automated SORA workflow to facilitate obtaining authorization, which is significantly helpful for operators, especially the scientific community, to conduct experimental operations."}
{"title":"Data-integrated uncertainty quantification for the performance prediction of iced airfoils","abstract":"Airfoil icing is a severe safety hazard in aviation and causes power losses on wind turbines. The precise shape of the ice formation is subject to large uncertainties, so uncertainty quantification (UQ) is needed for a reliable prediction of its effects. In this study, we aim to establish a reliable estimate of the effect of icing on airfoil performance through UQ. We use a series of experimentally measured wind tunnel ice shapes as input data. Principal component analysis is employed to construct a set of linearly uncorrelated geometric modes from the data, which serves as random input to the UQ simulation. For uncertainty propagation, non-intrusive polynomial chaos expansion (NIPC), multi-level Monte Carlo (MLMC) and multi-fidelity Monte Carlo control variate (MFMC) methods are employed and compared. As a baseline model, large eddy simulations (LES) are carried out using the discontinuous Galerkin flow solver FLEXI. UQ simulations are carried out with the in-house framework PoUnce. Its focus is on a high level of automation and efficiency considerations in a high performance computing environment. Due to the high number of samples, the simulation tool chain of the baseline model is completely automatized, including a new structured boundary layer grid generator for highly irregular domain shapes. The results show that forces on the airfoil vary considerably due to the uncertain ice shape. All three methods prove to be suited to predict mean and standard deviation. In the Monte Carlo techniques, the choice and performance of low-fidelity models is shown to be decisive for estimator variance reduction. The MFMC method performs best in this study. To our knowledge, there are no UQ studies of iced airfoils based on LES, let alone with advanced UQ methods such as MLMC or MFMC. The present study thus represents a leap in accuracy and level of detail for this application."}
{"title":"Graph Learning Based Decision Support for Multi-Aircraft Take-Off and Landing at Urban Air Mobility Vertiports","abstract":"Majority of aircraft under the Urban Air Mobility (UAM) concept are expected to be of the electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) vehicle type, which will operate out of vertiports. While this is akin to the relationship between general aviation aircraft and airports, the conceived location of vertiports within dense urban environments presents unique challenges in managing the air traffic served by a vertiport. This challenge becomes pronounced within increasing frequency of scheduled landings and take-offs. This paper assumes a centralized air traffic controller (ATC) to explore the performance of a new AI driven ATC approach to manage the eVTOLs served by the vertiport. Minimum separation-driven safety and delays are the two important considerations in this case. The ATC problem is modeled as a task allocation problem, and uncertainties due to communication disruptions (e.g., poor link quality) and inclement weather (e.g., high gust effects) are added as a small probability of action failures. To learn the vertiport ATC policy, a novel graph-based reinforcement learning (RL) solution called \"Urban Air Mobility- Vertiport Schedule Management (UAM-VSM)\" is developed. This approach uses graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to abstract the vertiport space and eVTOL space as graphs, and aggregate information for a centralized ATC agent to help generalize the environment. Unreal Engine combined with Airsim is used as the simulation environment over which training and testing occurs. Uncertainties are considered only during testing, due to the high cost of Mc sampling over such realistic simulations. The proposed graph RL method demonstrates significantly better performance on the test scenarios when compared against a feasible random decision-making baseline and a first come first serve (FCFS) baseline, including the ability to generalize to unseen scenarios and with uncertainties."}
{"title":"Natural Language Processing of Aviation Occurrence Reports for Safety Management","abstract":"Occurrence reporting is a commonly used method in safety management systems to obtain insight in the prevalence of hazards and accident scenarios. In support of safety data analysis, reports are often categorized according to a taxonomy. However, the processing of the reports can require significant effort from safety analysts and a common problem is interrater variability in labeling processes. Also, in some cases, reports are not processed according to a taxonomy, or the taxonomy does not fully cover the contents of the documents. This paper explores various Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to support the analysis of aviation safety occurrence reports. In particular, the problems studied are the automatic labeling of reports using a classification model, extracting the latent topics in a collection of texts using a topic model and the automatic generation of probable cause texts. Experimental results showed that (i) under the right conditions the labeling of occurrence reports can be effectively automated with a transformer-based classifier, (ii) topic modeling can be useful for finding the topics present in a collection of reports, and (iii) using a summarization model can be a promising direction for generating probable cause texts."}

In this paper, we focus on knowledge-infused link prediction and question answering using language models, T5, and BLOOM across three domains: Aviation, Movie, and Web. In this context, we infuse knowledge in large and small language models and study their performance, and find the performance to be similar. For the link prediction task on the Aviation Knowledge Graph, we obtain a 0.2 hits@1 score using T5-small, T5-base, T5-large, and BLOOM. Using template-based scripts, we create a set of 1 million synthetic factoid QA pairs in the aviation domain from National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) reports. On our curated QA pairs, the three models of T5 achieve a 0.7 hits@1 score. We validate out findings with the paired student t-test and Cohen's kappa scores. For link prediction on Aviation Knowledge Graph using T5-small and T5-large, we obtain a Cohen's kappa score of 0.76, showing substantial agreement between the models. Thus, we infer that small language models perform similar to large language models with the infusion of knowledge."}
{"title":"Architecting Safer Autonomous Aviation Systems","abstract":"The aviation literature gives relatively little guidance to practitioners about the specifics of architecting systems for safety, particularly the impact of architecture on allocating safety requirements, or the relative ease of system assurance resulting from system or subsystem level architectural choices. As an exemplar, this paper considers common architectural patterns used within traditional aviation systems and explores their safety and safety assurance implications when applied in the context of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) based functionality. Considering safety as an architectural property, we discuss both the allocation of safety requirements and the architectural trade-offs involved early in the design lifecycle. This approach could be extended to other assured properties, similar to safety, such as security. We conclude with a discussion of the safety considerations that emerge in the context of candidate architectural patterns that have been proposed in the recent literature for enabling autonomy capabilities by integrating AI and ML. A recommendation is made for the generation of a property-driven architectural pattern catalogue."}
{"title":"Reward Function Optimization of a Deep Reinforcement Learning Collision Avoidance System","abstract":"The proliferation of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) has caused airspace regulation authorities to examine the interoperability of these aircraft with collision avoidance systems initially designed for large transport category aircraft. Limitations in the currently mandated TCAS led the Federal Aviation Administration to commission the development of a new solution, the Airborne Collision Avoidance System X (ACAS X), designed to enable a collision avoidance capability for multiple aircraft platforms, including UAS. While prior research explored using deep reinforcement learning algorithms (DRL) for collision avoidance, DRL did not perform as well as existing solutions. This work explores the benefits of using a DRL collision avoidance system whose parameters are tuned using a surrogate optimizer. We show the use of a surrogate optimizer leads to DRL approach that can increase safety and operational viability and support future capability development for UAS collision avoidance."}
{"title":"A taxonomic system for failure cause analysis of open source AI incidents","abstract":"While certain industrial sectors (e.g., aviation) have a long history of mandatory incident reporting complete with analytical findings, the practice of artificial intelligence (AI) safety benefits from no such mandate and thus analyses must be performed on publicly known ``open source'' AI incidents. Although the exact causes of AI incidents are seldom known by outsiders, this work demonstrates how to apply expert knowledge on the population of incidents in the AI Incident Database (AIID) to infer the potential and likely technical causative factors that contribute to reported failures and harms. We present early work on a taxonomic system that covers a cascade of interrelated incident factors, from system goals (nearly always known) to methods \/ technologies (knowable in many cases) and technical failure causes (subject to expert analysis) of the implicated systems. We pair this ontology structure with a comprehensive classification workflow that leverages expert knowledge and community feedback, resulting in taxonomic annotations grounded by incident data and human expertise."}

The integrity of these communication links is critical for the safety of operations. Several security requirements also have to be met on each of these links. Unfortunately, current cryptographic standards used over the internet are most often not suitable to UAS due to their limited resources and dynamic nature. This survey discusses the security required for every communication link in order to enable a safe traffic management. Research works focusing on the security of communication links using cryptographic primitives are then presented and discussed. Authentication protocols developed for UAVs or other constrained systems are compared and evaluated as solutions for UAS security. Symmetrical alternatives to the AES algorithm are also presented. Works to secure current UTM protocols such as ADS-B and RemoteID are discussed. The analysis reveals a need for the development of a complete secure architecture able to provide authentication and integrity to external systems (other aircraft, UTM systems...)."}
{"title":"A Survey on Reinforcement Learning in Aviation Applications","abstract":"Compared with model-based control and optimization methods, reinforcement learning (RL) provides a data-driven, learning-based framework to formulate and solve sequential decision-making problems. The RL framework has become promising due to largely improved data availability and computing power in the aviation industry. Many aviation-based applications can be formulated or treated as sequential decision-making problems. Some of them are offline planning problems, while others need to be solved online and are safety-critical. In this survey paper, we first describe standard RL formulations and solutions. Then we survey the landscape of existing RL-based applications in aviation. Finally, we summarize the paper, identify the technical gaps, and suggest future directions of RL research in aviation."}
{"title":"Toward Certification of Machine-Learning Systems for Low Criticality Airborne Applications","abstract":"The exceptional progress in the field of machine learning (ML) in recent years has attracted a lot of interest in using this technology in aviation. Possible airborne applications of ML include safety-critical functions, which must be developed in compliance with rigorous certification standards of the aviation industry. Current certification standards for the aviation industry were developed prior to the ML renaissance without taking specifics of ML technology into account. There are some fundamental incompatibilities between traditional design assurance approaches and certain aspects of ML-based systems. In this paper, we analyze the current airborne certification standards and show that all objectives of the standards can be achieved for a low-criticality ML-based system if certain assumptions about ML development workflow are applied."}
{"title":"BFL: a Logic to Reason about Fault Trees","abstract":"Safety-critical infrastructures must operate safely and reliably. Fault tree analysis is a widespread method used to assess risks in these systems: fault trees (FTs) are required - among others - by the Federal Aviation Authority, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, in the ISO26262 standard for autonomous driving and for software development in aerospace systems. Although popular both in industry and academia, FTs lack a systematic way to formulate powerful and understandable analysis queries. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap and introduce Boolean Fault tree Logic (BFL), a logic to reason about FTs. BFL is a simple, yet expressive logic that supports easier formulation of complex scenarios and specification of FT properties. Alongside BFL, we present model checking algorithms based on binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to analyse specified properties in BFL, patterns and an algorithm to construct counterexamples. Finally, we propose a case-study application of BFL by analysing a COVID19-related FT."}
{"title":"Safety Analysis Methods for Complex Systems in Aviation","abstract":"Each new concept of operation and equipment generation in aviation becomes more automated, integrated and interconnected. In the case of Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS), this evolution allows drastically decreasing aircraft weight and operational cost, but these benefits are also realized in highly automated manned aircraft and ground Air Traffic Control (ATC) systems. The downside of these advances is overwhelmingly more complex software and hardware, making it harder to identify potential failure paths. Although there are mandatory certification processes based on broadly accepted standards, such as ARP4754 and its family, ESARR 4 and others, these standards do not allow proof or disproof of safety of disruptive technology changes, such as GBAS Precision Approaches, Autonomous UAS, aircraft self-separation and others. In order to leverage the introduction of such concepts, it is necessary to develop solid knowledge on the foundations of safety in complex systems and use this knowledge to elaborate sound demonstrations of either safety or unsafety of new system designs. These demonstrations at early design stages will help reducing costs both on development of new technology as well as reducing the risk of such technology causing accidents when in use.\n  This paper presents some safety analysis methods which are not in the industry standards but which we identify as having benefits for analyzing safety of advanced technological concepts in aviation."}
{"title":"Joint Ranging and Phase Offset Estimation for Multiple Drones using ADS-B Signatures","abstract":"A new method for joint ranging and Phase Offset (PO) estimation of multiple drones\/aircrafts is proposed in this paper. The proposed method employs the superimposed uncoordinated Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) packets broadcasted by drones\/aircrafts for joint range and PO estimation. It jointly estimates range and PO prior to ADS-B packet decoding; thus, it can improve air safety when packet decoding is infeasible due to packet collision. Moreover, it enables coherent detection of ADS-B packets, which can result in more reliable multiple target tracking in aviation systems using cooperative sensors for detect and avoid (DAA). By minimizing the Kullback Leibler Divergence (KLD) statistical distance measure, we show that the received complex baseband signal coming from K uncoordinated drones corrupted by Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) at a single antenna receiver can be approximated by an independent and identically distributed Gaussian Mixture (GM) with 2 power K mixture components in the two dimensional (2D) plane. While direct joint Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of range and PO from the derived GM Probability Density Function (PDF) leads to an intractable maximization, our proposed method employs the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate the modes of the 2D Gaussian mixture followed by a reordering estimation technique through combinatorial optimization to estimate range and PO. An extension to a multiple antenna receiver is also investigated in this paper. While the proposed estimator can estimate the range of multiple drones with a single receive antenna, a larger number of drones can be supported with higher accuracy by the use of multiple antennas at the receiver. The effectiveness of the proposed estimator is supported by simulation results. We show that the proposed estimator can jointly estimate the range of three drones accurately."}
{"title":"Ontology-Based Anomaly Detection for Air Traffic Control Systems","abstract":"The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) protocol is increasingly being adopted by the aviation industry as a method for aircraft to relay their position to Air Traffic Control (ATC) monitoring systems. ADS-B provides greater precision compared to traditional radar-based technologies, however, it was designed without any encryption or authentication mechanisms and has been shown to be susceptible to spoofing attacks. A capable attacker can transmit falsified ADS-B messages with the intent of causing false information to be shown on ATC displays and threaten the safety of air traffic. Updating the ADS-B protocol will be a lengthy process, therefore, there is a need for systems to detect anomalous ADS-B communications. This paper presents ATC-Sense, an ADS-B anomaly detection system based on ontologies. An ATC ontology is used to model entities in a simulated controlled airspace and is used to detect falsified ADS-B messages by verifying that the entities conform to aviation constraints related to aircraft flight tracks, radar readings, and flight reports. We evaluate the computational performance of the proposed constraints-based detection approach with several ADS-B attack scenarios in a simulated ATC environment. We demonstrate how ontologies can be used for anomaly detection in a real-time environment and call for future work to investigate ways to improve the computational performance of such an approach."}
{"title":"Reliable Flight Control: Gravity-Compensation-First Principle","abstract":"Safety is always the priority in aviation. However, current state-of-the-art passive fault-tolerant control is too conservative to use; current state-of-the-art active fault-tolerant control requires time to perform fault detection and diagnosis, and control switching. But it may be later to recover impaired aircraft. Most designs depend on failures determined as a priori and cannot deal with fault, causing the original system's state to be uncontrollable. However, experienced human pilots can save a serve impaired aircraft as far as they can. Motivated by this, this paper develops a principle to try to explain human pilot behavior behind, coined the gravity-compensation-first principle. This further supports reliable flight control for aircraft such as quadcopters and tail-sitter unmanned aerial vehicles."}
{"title":"Knowledge Graph - Deep Learning: A Case Study in Question Answering in Aviation Safety Domain","abstract":"In the commercial aviation domain, there are a large number of documents, like, accident reports (NTSB, ASRS) and regulatory directives (ADs). There is a need for a system to access these diverse repositories efficiently in order to service needs in the aviation industry, like maintenance, compliance, and safety. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG) guided Deep Learning (DL) based Question Answering (QA) system for aviation safety. We construct a Knowledge Graph from Aircraft Accident reports and contribute this resource to the community of researchers. The efficacy of this resource is tested and proved by the aforesaid QA system. Natural Language Queries constructed from the documents mentioned above are converted into SPARQL (the interface language of the RDF graph database) queries and answered. On the DL side, we have two different QA models: (i) BERT QA which is a pipeline of Passage Retrieval (Sentence-BERT based) and Question Answering (BERT based), and (ii) the recently released GPT-3. We evaluate our system on a set of queries created from the accident reports. Our combined QA system achieves 9.3% increase in accuracy over GPT-3 and 40.3% increase over BERT QA. Thus, we infer that KG-DL performs better than either singly."}
{"title":"An Application of D-vine Regression for the Identification of Risky Flights in Runway Overrun","abstract":"In aviation safety, runway overruns are of great importance because they are the most frequent type of landing accidents. Identification of factors which contribute to the occurrence of runway overruns can help mitigate the risk and prevent such accidents. Methods such as physics-based and statistical-based models were proposed in the past to estimate runway overrun probabilities. However, they are either costly or require experts' knowledge. We propose a statistical approach to quantify the risk probability of an aircraft to exceed a threshold at the speed of 80 knots given a set of influencing factors. This copula based D-vine regression approach is used because it allows for complex tail dependence and is computationally tractable. Data obtained from the Quick Access Recorder (QAR) for 711 flights are analyzed. We identify 41 flights with an estimated risk probability > 0.001 for a chosen threshold and rank the effects of each influencing factor for these flights. Also, the complex dependency patterns between some influencing factors for the 41 flights are shown to be non symmetric. The D-vine regression approach, compared to physics-based and statistical-based approaches, has an analytical solution, is not simulation based and can be used to estimate very small or large probabilities efficiently."}
{"title":"A Verification Framework for Certifying Learning-Based Safety-Critical Aviation Systems","abstract":"We present a safety verification framework for design-time and run-time assurance of learning-based components in aviation systems. Our proposed framework integrates two novel methodologies. From the design-time assurance perspective, we propose offline mixed-fidelity verification tools that incorporate knowledge from different levels of granularity in simulated environments. From the run-time assurance perspective, we propose reachability- and statistics-based online monitoring and safety guards for a learning-based decision-making model to complement the offline verification methods. This framework is designed to be loosely coupled among modules, allowing the individual modules to be developed using independent methodologies and techniques, under varying circumstances and with different tool access. The proposed framework offers feasible solutions for meeting system safety requirements at different stages throughout the system development and deployment cycle, enabling the continuous learning and assessment of the system product."}
{"title":"Collision Risk and Operational Impact of Speed Change Advisories as Aircraft Collision Avoidance Maneuvers","abstract":"Aircraft collision avoidance systems have long been a key factor in keeping our airspace safe. Over the past decade, the FAA has supported the development of a new family of collision avoidance systems called the Airborne Collision Avoidance System X (ACAS X), which model the collision avoidance problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). Variants of ACAS X have been created for both manned (ACAS Xa) and unmanned aircraft (ACAS Xu and ACAS sXu). The variants primarily differ in the types of collision avoidance maneuvers they issue. For example, ACAS Xa issues vertical collision avoidance advisories, while ACAS Xu and ACAS sXu allow for horizontal advisories due to reduced aircraft performance capabilities. Currently, a new variant of ACAS X, called ACAS Xr, is being developed to provide collision avoidance capability to rotorcraft and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) vehicles. Due to the desire to minimize deviation from the prescribed flight path of these aircraft, speed adjustments have been proposed as a potential collision avoidance maneuver for aircraft using ACAS Xr. In this work, we investigate the effect of speed change advisories on the safety and operational efficiency of collision avoidance systems. We develop an MDP-based collision avoidance logic that issues speed advisories and compare its performance to that of horizontal and vertical logics through Monte Carlo simulation on existing airspace encounter models. Our results show that while speed advisories are able to reduce collision risk, they are neither as safe nor as efficient as their horizontal and vertical counterparts."}
{"title":"Macroscopic analysis of time dependent plasticity in Ti alloys","abstract":"Component failure due to cold dwell fatigue of titanium and its alloys is a long-standing problem which has significant safety and economic implications to the aviation industry. This can be addressed by understanding the governing mechanisms of time dependent plasticity behaviour of Ti at low temperatures. Here, stress relaxation tests were performed at four different temperatures on three major alloy systems: commercially pure titanium (two alloys with different oxygen content), Ti-6Al-4V (two microstructures with differing beta phase fractions) and Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-xMo (two alloys with different Mo content x= 2 or 6, and portion of beta phase). Key parameters controlling the time dependent plasticity were determined as a function of temperature. Both activation volume and energy were found to increase with temperature in all six alloys. It was found that the dwell fatigue effect is more significant by oxygen alloying but is suppressed by the addition of Mo. The presence of the beta phase did not strongly affect the dwell fatigue, however, it was suppressed at high temperature due to the low strain rate and strain rate sensitivity."}
{"title":"The Chaotic State of UK Drone Regulation","abstract":"In December 2020 the law for drone pilots and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) use went into a transition phase in preparation for new EU international UAV regulation. That EU regulation comes into full effect as the transition periods defined in the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority Air Policy CAP722 expire during December 2022 (CAA, 2020). However, international homologation regulation will not address the patchwork of inconsistent drone use regulations that exist in the United Kingdom from the layering of local and subordinate authority byelaws over UK aviation law. We provide an extensive review of local authority regulation of drone use on public open and green spaces, finding that many local authorities are unaware of the issues being created through: (i) inappropriately couched or poorly framed byelaws; (ii) multiple byelaws covering the same area by virtue of overlapping jurisdictions; or (iii) the lack readily identifiable policies for drone use on public land. Overregulation, inconsistent regulation and regulatory disharmony are causing confusion for recreational drone enthusiasts such that it is never clear which public or crown-owned open and green spaces they are allowed to, or prohibited from, flying. While the government and local authorities might like them to, drones are not going away. Therefore, we conclude, the easiest way to ensure citizens stay within the bounds of drone law that is intended to ensure public safety, is to make that law comprehensible, consistent and easy to comply with."}
{"title":"Anomaly Detection for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Sensor Data Using a Stacked Recurrent Autoencoder Method with Dynamic Thresholding","abstract":"With substantial recent developments in aviation technologies, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are becoming increasingly integrated in commercial and military operations internationally. Research into the applications of aircraft data is essential in improving safety, reducing operational costs, and developing the next frontier of aerial technology. Having an outlier detection system that can accurately identify anomalous behaviour in aircraft is crucial for these reasons. This paper proposes a system incorporating a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Deep Learning Autoencoder based method with a novel dynamic thresholding algorithm and weighted loss function for anomaly detection of a UAV dataset, in order to contribute to the ongoing efforts that leverage innovations in machine learning and data analysis within the aviation industry. The dynamic thresholding and weighted loss functions showed promising improvements to the standard static thresholding method, both in accuracy-related performance metrics and in speed of true fault detection."}
{"title":"Design of Outdoor Autonomous Moble Robot","abstract":"This study presents the design of a six-wheeled outdoor autonomous mobile robot. The main design goal of our robot is to increase its adaptability and flexibility when moving outdoors. This six-wheeled robot platform was equipped with some sensors, such as a global positioning system (GPS), high definition (HD) webcam, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), and rotary encoders. A personal mobile computer and 86Duino ONE microcontroller were used as the algorithm computing platform. In terms of control, the lateral offset and head angle offset of the robot were calculated using a differential GPS or a camera to detect structured and unstructured road boundaries. The lateral offset and head angle offset were fed to a fuzzy controller. The control input was designed by Q-learning of the differential speed between the left and right wheels. This made the robot track a reference route so that it could stay in its own lane. 2D LiDAR was also used to measure the relative distance from the front obstacle. The robot would immediately stop to avoid a collision when the distance between the robot and obstacle was less than a specific safety distance. A custom-designed rocker arm gave the robot the ability to climb a low step. Body balance could be maintained by controlling the angle of the rocker arm when the robot changed its pose. The autonomous mobile robot has been used for delivery service on our campus road by integrating the above system functionality."}
{"title":"Lithium-ion battery degradation: how to model it","abstract":"Predicting lithium-ion battery degradation is worth billions to the global automotive, aviation and energy storage industries, to improve performance and safety and reduce warranty liabilities. However, very few published models of battery degradation explicitly consider the interactions between more than two degradation mechanisms, and none do so within a single electrode. In this paper, the first published attempt to directly couple more than two degradation mechanisms in the negative electrode is reported. The results are used to map different pathways through the complicated path dependent and non-linear degradation space. Four degradation mechanisms are coupled in PyBaMM, an open source modelling environment uniquely developed to allow new physics to be implemented and explored quickly and easily. Crucially it is possible to see 'inside' the model and observe the consequences of the different patterns of degradation, such as loss of lithium inventory and loss of active material. For the same cell, five different pathways that can result in end-of-life have already been found, depending on how the cell is used. Such information would enable a product designer to either extend life or predict life based upon the usage pattern. However, parameterization of the degradation models remains as a major challenge, and requires the attention of the international battery community."}
{"title":"A Secure Experimentation Sandbox for the design and execution of trusted and secure analytics in the aviation domain","abstract":"The aviation industry as well as the industries that benefit and are linked to it are ripe for innovation in the form of Big Data analytics. The number of available big data technologies is constantly growing, while at the same time the existing ones are rapidly evolving and empowered with new features. However, the Big Data era imposes the crucial challenge of how to effectively handle information security while managing massive and rapidly evolving data from heterogeneous data sources. While multiple technologies have emerged, there is a need to find a balance between multiple security requirements, privacy obligations, system performance and rapid dynamic analysis on large datasets. The current paper aims to introduce the ICARUS Secure Experimentation Sandbox of the ICARUS platform. The ICARUS platform aims to provide a big data-enabled platform that aspires to become an 'one-stop shop' for aviation data and intelligence marketplace that provides a trusted and secure 'sandboxed' analytics workspace, allowing the exploration, integration and deep analysis of original and derivative data in a trusted and fair manner. Towards this end, a Secure Experimentation Sandbox has been designed and integrated in the ICARUS platform offering, that enables the provisioning of a sophisticated environment that can completely guarantee the safety and confidentiality of data, allowing to any interested party to utilise the platform to conduct analytical experiments in closed-lab conditions."}
{"title":"On Assessing The Safety of Reinforcement Learning algorithms Using Formal Methods","abstract":"The increasing adoption of Reinforcement Learning in safety-critical systems domains such as autonomous vehicles, health, and aviation raises the need for ensuring their safety. Existing safety mechanisms such as adversarial training, adversarial detection, and robust learning are not always adapted to all disturbances in which the agent is deployed. Those disturbances include moving adversaries whose behavior can be unpredictable by the agent, and as a matter of fact harmful to its learning. Ensuring the safety of critical systems also requires methods that give formal guarantees on the behaviour of the agent evolving in a perturbed environment. It is therefore necessary to propose new solutions adapted to the learning challenges faced by the agent. In this paper, first we generate adversarial agents that exhibit flaws in the agent's policy by presenting moving adversaries. Secondly, We use reward shaping and a modified Q-learning algorithm as defense mechanisms to improve the agent's policy when facing adversarial perturbations. Finally, probabilistic model checking is employed to evaluate the effectiveness of both mechanisms. We have conducted experiments on a discrete grid world with a single agent facing non-learning and learning adversaries. Our results show a diminution in the number of collisions between the agent and the adversaries. Probabilistic model checking provides lower and upper probabilistic bounds regarding the agent's safety in the adversarial environment."}
{"title":"Monitoring with Verified Guarantees","abstract":"Runtime monitoring is generally considered a light-weight alternative to formal verification. In safety-critical systems, however, the monitor itself is a critical component. For example, if the monitor is responsible for initiating emergency protocols, as proposed in a recent aviation standard, then the safety of the entire system critically depends on guarantees of the correctness of the monitor. In this paper, we present a verification extension to the Lola monitoring language that integrates the efficient specification of the monitor with Hoare-style annotations that guarantee the correctness of the monitor specification. We add two new operators, assume and assert, which specify assumptions of the monitor and expectations on its output, respectively. The validity of the annotations is established by an integrated SMT solver. We report on experience in applying the approach to specifications from the avionics domain, where the annotation with assumptions and assertions has lead to the discovery of safety-critical errors in the specifications. The errors range from incorrect default values in offset computations to complex algorithmic errors that result in unexpected temporal patterns."}
{"title":"Predictive Maintenance for General Aviation Using Convolutional Transformers","abstract":"Predictive maintenance systems have the potential to significantly reduce costs for maintaining aircraft fleets as well as provide improved safety by detecting maintenance issues before they come severe. However, the development of such systems has been limited due to a lack of publicly labeled multivariate time series (MTS) sensor data. MTS classification has advanced greatly over the past decade, but there is a lack of sufficiently challenging benchmarks for new methods. This work introduces the NGAFID Maintenance Classification (NGAFID-MC) dataset as a novel benchmark in terms of difficulty, number of samples, and sequence length. NGAFID-MC consists of over 7,500 labeled flights, representing over 11,500 hours of per second flight data recorder readings of 23 sensor parameters. Using this benchmark, we demonstrate that Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) methods are not well suited for capturing temporally distant relationships and propose a new architecture called Convolutional Multiheaded Self Attention (Conv-MHSA) that achieves greater classification performance at greater computational efficiency. We also demonstrate that image inspired augmentations of cutout, mixup, and cutmix, can be used to reduce overfitting and improve generalization in MTS classification. Our best trained models have been incorporated back into the NGAFID to allow users to potentially detect flights that require maintenance as well as provide feedback to further expand and refine the NGAFID-MC dataset."}
{"title":"Comparing the Performance of Traffic Coordination Methods for Advanced Aerial Mobility","abstract":"Traffic Management in Advanced Aerial Mobility (AAM) inherits many elements of conventional Air Traffic Management (ATM), but brings new complexities and challenges of its own. One of its ways of guaranteeing separation is the use of airborne, stand-alone Detect-And-Avoid, an operational concept where each aircraft decides its avoidance maneuvers independently, observing right-of-way rules and, in specific implementations, some form of pairwise coordination. This is a fundamental safety element for autonomous aircraft but, according to our research, is not sufficient for high-density airspaces as envisioned for urban environments. In these environments, some way of explicit and strategic traffic coordination must be in place, as done for conventional ATM. For efficiency reasons, ATM is evolving to more flexible uses of the airspace, such that the use of dynamically allocated corridors is a rising concept for AAM. These strategic forms of traffic coordination are potentially highly efficient if the aircraft adhere to their trajectory contracts and there are no significant perturbations to the traffic. However, if significant perturbations occur, such as loss of data communication, or the sudden appearance of an intruder, a centralized system may not react appropriately in due time. In busy scenarios, even small deviations from plans may compound so rapidly as to result in large differences in the overall achieved scenario, resulting in congestions and convoluted conflicts. Therefore, it is worth studying traffic coordination techniques that work locally with shorter look-ahead times. To that end, we explore an airborne collaborative method for traffic coordination, which is capable of safely solving conflicts with multiple aircraft, stressing its capabilities throughout a large number of scenarios and comparing its performance with established methods."}
{"title":"A Decision Support System for Safer Airplane Landings: Predicting Runway Conditions Using XGBoost and Explainable AI","abstract":"The presence of snow and ice on runway surfaces reduces the available tire-pavement friction needed for retardation and directional control and causes potential economic and safety threats for the aviation industry during the winter seasons. To activate appropriate safety procedures, pilots need accurate and timely information on the actual runway surface conditions. In this study, XGBoost is used to create a combined runway assessment system, which includes a classification model to identify slippery conditions and a regression model to predict the level of slipperiness. The models are trained on weather data and runway reports. The runway surface conditions are represented by the tire-pavement friction coefficient, which is estimated from flight sensor data from landing aircrafts. The XGBoost models are combined with SHAP approximations to provide a reliable decision support system for airport operators, which can contribute to safer and more economic operations of airport runways. To evaluate the performance of the prediction models, they are compared to several state-of-the-art runway assessment methods. The XGBoost models identify slippery runway conditions with a ROC AUC of 0.95, predict the friction coefficient with a MAE of 0.0254, and outperforms all the previous methods. The results show the strong abilities of machine learning methods to model complex, physical phenomena with a good accuracy.

{"title":"Agile wide-field imaging with selective high resolution","abstract":"Wide-field and high-resolution (HR) imaging is essential for various applications such as aviation reconnaissance, topographic mapping and safety monitoring. The existing techniques require a large-scale detector array to capture HR images of the whole field, resulting in high complexity and heavy cost. In this work, we report an agile wide-field imaging framework with selective high resolution that requires only two detectors. It builds on the statistical sparsity prior of natural scenes that the important targets locate only at small regions of interests (ROI), instead of the whole field. Under this assumption, we use a short-focal camera to image wide field with a certain low resolution, and use a long-focal camera to acquire the HR images of ROI. To automatically locate ROI in the wide field in real time, we propose an efficient deep-learning based multiscale registration method that is robust and blind to the large setting differences (focal, white balance, etc) between the two cameras. Using the registered location, the long-focal camera mounted on a gimbal enables real-time tracking of the ROI for continuous HR imaging. We demonstrated the novel imaging framework by building a proof-of-concept setup with only 1181 gram weight, and assembled it on an unmanned aerial vehicle for air-to-ground monitoring. Experiments show that the setup maintains 120$^{\\circ}$ wide field-of-view (FOV) with selective 0.45$mrad$ instantaneous FOV."}
{"title":"Zero-bias Deep Learning Enabled Quick and Reliable Abnormality Detection in IoT","abstract":"Abnormality detection is essential to the performance of safety-critical and latency-constrained systems. However, as systems are becoming increasingly complicated with a large quantity of heterogeneous data, conventional statistical change point detection methods are becoming less effective and efficient. Although Deep Learning (DL) and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly employed to handle heterogeneous data, they still lack theoretic assurable performance and explainability. This paper integrates zero-bias DNN and Quickest Event Detection algorithms to provide a holistic framework for quick and reliable detection of both abnormalities and time-dependent abnormal events in the Internet of Things (IoT). We first use the zero-bias dense layer to increase the explainability of DNN. We provide a solution to convert zero-bias DNN classifiers into performance assured binary abnormality detectors. Using the converted abnormality detector, we then present a sequential quickest detection scheme that provides the theoretically assured lowest abnormal event detection delay under false alarm constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework using both massive signal records from real-world aviation communication systems and simulated data.

{"title":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Visual Detection and Tracking using Deep Neural Networks: A Performance Benchmark","abstract":"Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) can pose a major risk for aviation safety, due to both negligent and malicious use. For this reason, the automated detection and tracking of UAV is a fundamental task in aerial security systems. Common technologies for UAV detection include visible-band and thermal infrared imaging, radio frequency and radar. Recent advances in deep neural networks (DNNs) for image-based object detection open the possibility to use visual information for this detection and tracking task. Furthermore, these detection architectures can be implemented as backbones for visual tracking systems, thereby enabling persistent tracking of UAV incursions. To date, no comprehensive performance benchmark exists that applies DNNs to visible-band imagery for UAV detection and tracking. To this end, three datasets with varied environmental conditions for UAV detection and tracking, comprising a total of 241 videos (331,486 images), are assessed using four detection architectures and three tracking frameworks. The best performing detector architecture obtains an mAP of 98.6% and the best performing tracking framework obtains a MOTA of 96.3%. Cross-modality evaluation is carried out between visible and infrared spectrums, achieving a maximal 82.8% mAP on visible images when training in the infrared modality. These results provide the first public multi-approach benchmark for state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods and give insight into which detection and tracking architectures are effective in the UAV domain."}
{"title":"Radiation Data Portal: Integration of Radiation Measurements at the Aviation Altitudes and Solar-Terrestrial Environment Observations","abstract":"The impact of radiation dramatically increases at high altitudes in the Earth's atmosphere and in space. Therefore, monitoring and access to radiation environment measurements are critical for estimating the radiation exposure risks of aircraft and spacecraft crews and the impact of space weather disturbances on electronics. Addressing these needs requires convenient access to multi-source radiation environment data and enhancement of visualization and search capabilities. The Radiation Data Portal represents an interactive web-based application for search and visualization of in-flight radiation measurements. The Portal enhances the exploration capabilities of various properties of the radiation environment and provides measurements of dose rates along with information on space weather-related conditions. The Radiation Data Portal back-end is a MySQL relational database that contains the radiation measurements obtained from the Automated Radiation Measurements for Aerospace Safety (ARMAS) device and the soft X-ray and proton flux measurements from the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). The implemented Application Programming Interface (API) and Python routines allow a user to retrieve the database records without interaction with the web interface. As a use case of the Radiation Data Portal, we examine ARMAS measurements during an enhancement of the Solar Proton (SP) fluxes, known as Solar Proton Events (SPEs), and compare them to measurements during SP-quiet periods."}
{"title":"Multi-Class Multiple Instance Learning for Predicting Precursors to Aviation Safety Events","abstract":"In recent years, there has been a rapid growth in the application of machine learning techniques that leverage aviation data collected from commercial airline operations to improve safety. Anomaly detection and predictive maintenance have been the main targets for machine learning applications. However, this paper focuses on the identification of precursors, which is a relatively newer application. Precursors are events correlated with adverse events that happen prior to the adverse event itself. Therefore, precursor mining provides many benefits including understanding the reasons behind a safety incident and the ability to identify signatures, which can be tracked throughout a flight to alert the operators of the potential for an adverse event in the future. This work proposes using the multiple-instance learning (MIL) framework, a weakly supervised learning task, combined with carefully designed binary classifier leveraging a Multi-Head Convolutional Neural Network-Recurrent Neural Network (MHCNN-RNN) architecture. Multi-class classifiers are then created and compared, enabling the prediction of different adverse events for any given flight by combining binary classifiers, and by modifying the MHCNN-RNN to handle multiple outputs. Results obtained showed that the multiple binary classifiers perform better and are able to accurately forecast high speed and high path angle events during the approach phase. Multiple binary classifiers are also capable of determining the aircraft's parameters that are correlated to these events. The identified parameters can be considered precursors to the events and may be studied\/tracked further to prevent these events in the future."}
{"title":"Applicability and Surrogacy of Uncorrelated Airspace Encounter Models at Low Altitudes","abstract":"The National Airspace System (NAS) is a complex and evolving system that enables safe and efficient aviation. Advanced air mobility concepts and new airspace entrants, such as unmanned aircraft, must integrate into the NAS without degrading overall safety or efficiency. For instance, regulations, standards, and systems are required to mitigate the risk of a midair collision between aircraft. Monte Carlo simulations have been a foundational capability for decades to develop, assess, and certify aircraft conflict avoidance systems. These are often validated through human-in-the-loop experiments and flight testing. For many aviation safety studies, manned aircraft behavior is represented using dynamic Bayesian networks. The original statistical models were developed from 2008-2013 to support safety simulations for altitudes above 500 feet Above Ground Level (AGL). However, these models were not sufficient to assess the safety of smaller UAS operations below 500 feet AGL. In response, newer models with altitude floors below 500 feet AGL have been in development since 2018. Many of the models assume that aircraft behavior is uncorrelated and not dependent on air traffic services or nearby aircraft. Our research objective was to compare the various uncorrelated models of conventional aircraft and identify how the models differ. Particularly if models of rotorcraft were sufficiently different than models of fixed-wing aircraft to require type specific models. The primary contribution is guidance on which uncorrelated models to leverage when evaluating the performance of a collision avoidance system designed for low altitude operations. We also address which models can be surrogates for noncooperative aircraft without transponders."}
{"title":"Towards an AI Coach to Infer Team Mental Model Alignment in Healthcare","abstract":"Shared mental models are critical to team success; however, in practice, team members may have misaligned models due to a variety of factors. In safety-critical domains (e.g., aviation, healthcare), lack of shared mental models can lead to preventable errors and harm. Towards the goal of mitigating such preventable errors, here, we present a Bayesian approach to infer misalignment in team members' mental models during complex healthcare task execution. As an exemplary application, we demonstrate our approach using two simulated team-based scenarios, derived from actual teamwork in cardiac surgery. In these simulated experiments, our approach inferred model misalignment with over 75% recall, thereby providing a building block for enabling computer-assisted interventions to augment human cognition in the operating room and improve teamwork."}
{"title":"Preventing Repeated Real World AI Failures by Cataloging Incidents: The AI Incident Database","abstract":"Mature industrial sectors (e.g., aviation) collect their real world failures in incident databases to inform safety improvements. Intelligent systems currently cause real world harms without a collective memory of their failings. As a result, companies repeatedly make the same mistakes in the design, development, and deployment of intelligent systems. A collection of intelligent system failures experienced in the real world (i.e., incidents) is needed to ensure intelligent systems benefit people and society. The AI Incident Database is an incident collection initiated by an industrial\/non-profit cooperative to enable AI incident avoidance and mitigation. The database supports a variety of research and development use cases with faceted and full text search on more than 1,000 incident reports archived to date."}
{"title":"A Lean and Highly-automated Model-Based Software Development Process Based on DO-178C\/DO-331","abstract":"The emergence of a global market for urban air mobility and unmanned aerial systems has attracted many startups across the world. These organizations have little training or experience in the traditional processes used in civil aviation for the development of software and electronic hardware. They are also constrained in the resources they can allocate for dedicated teams of professionals to follow these standardized processes. To fill this gap, this paper presents a custom workflow based on a subset of objectives derived from the foundational standards for safety critical software DO-178C\/DO-331. The selection of objectives from the standards is based on the importance, degree of automation, and reusability of specific objectives. This custom workflow is intended to establish a lean and highly automated development life cycle resulting in higher quality software with better maintainability characteristics for research and prototype aircraft. It can also be proposed as means of compliance for software of certain applications such as unmanned aircraft systems, urban air mobility and general aviation. By producing the essential set of development and verification artifacts, the custom workflow also provides a scalable basis for potential future certification in compliance with DO-178C\/DO-331. The custom workflow is demonstrated in a case study of an Autopilot Manual Disconnection System."}
{"title":"Understanding Realistic Attacks on Airborne Collision Avoidance Systems","abstract":"Airborne collision avoidance systems provide an onboard safety net should normal air traffic control procedures fail to keep aircraft separated. These systems are widely deployed and have been constantly refined over the past three decades, usually in response to near misses or mid-air collisions. Recent years have seen security research increasingly focus on aviation, identifying that key wireless links---some of which are used in collision avoidance---are vulnerable to attack. In this paper, we go one step further to understand whether an attacker can remotely trigger false collision avoidance alarms. Primarily considering the next-generation Airborne Collision Avoidance System X (ACAS X), we adopt a modelling approach to extract attacker constraints from technical standards before simulating collision avoidance attacks against standardized ACAS X code. We find that in 44% of cases, an attacker can successfully trigger a collision avoidance alert which on average results in a 590 ft altitude deviation; when the aircraft is at lower altitudes, this success rate rises considerably to 79%. Furthermore, we show how our simulation approach can be used to help defend against attacks by identifying where attackers are most likely to be successful."}
{"title":"Quantifying Assurance in Learning-enabled Systems","abstract":"Dependability assurance of systems embedding machine learning(ML) components---so called learning-enabled systems (LESs)---is a key step for their use in safety-critical applications. In emerging standardization and guidance efforts, there is a growing consensus in the value of using assurance cases for that purpose. This paper develops a quantitative notion of assurance that an LES is dependable, as a core component of its assurance case, also extending our prior work that applied to ML components. Specifically, we characterize LES assurance in the form of assurance measures: a probabilistic quantification of confidence that an LES possesses system-level properties associated with functional capabilities and dependability attributes. We illustrate the utility of assurance measures by application to a real world autonomous aviation system, also describing their role both in i) guiding high-level, runtime risk mitigation decisions and ii) as a core component of the associated dynamic assurance case."}
{"title":"An Incremental Clustering Method for Anomaly Detection in Flight Data","abstract":"Safety is a top priority for civil aviation. New anomaly detection methods, primarily clustering methods, have been developed to monitor pilot operations and detect any risks from such flight data. However, all existing anomaly detection methods are offlline learning - the models are trained once using historical data and used for all future predictions. In practice, new flight data are accumulated continuously and analyzed every month at airlines. Clustering such dynamically growing data is challenging for an offlline method because it is memory and time intensive to re-train the model every time new data come in. If the model is not re-trained, false alarms or missed detections may increase since the model cannot reflect changes in data patterns. To address this problem, we propose a novel incremental anomaly detection method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify common patterns and detect outliers in flight operations from digital flight data. It is a probabilistic clustering model of flight operations that can incrementally update its clusters based on new data rather than to re-cluster all data from scratch. It trains an initial GMM model based on historical offlline data. Then, it continuously adapts to new incoming data points via an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. To track changes in flight operation patterns, only model parameters need to be saved. The proposed method was tested on three sets of simulation data and two sets of real-world flight data. Compared with the traditional offline GMM method, the proposed method can generate similar clustering results with significantly reduced processing time (57 % - 99 % time reduction in testing sets) and memory usage (91 % - 95 % memory usage reduction in testing sets). Preliminary results indicate that the incremental learning scheme is effective in dealing with dynamically growing data in flight data analytics."}
{"title":"Robot Accident Investigation: a case study in Responsible Robotics","abstract":"Robot accidents are inevitable. Although rare, they have been happening since assembly-line robots were first introduced in the 1960s. But a new generation of social robots are now becoming commonplace. Often with sophisticated embedded artificial intelligence (AI) social robots might be deployed as care robots to assist elderly or disabled people to live independently. Smart robot toys offer a compelling interactive play experience for children and increasingly capable autonomous vehicles (AVs) the promise of hands-free personal transport and fully autonomous taxis. Unlike industrial robots which are deployed in safety cages, social robots are designed to operate in human environments and interact closely with humans; the likelihood of robot accidents is therefore much greater for social robots than industrial robots. This paper sets out a draft framework for social robot accident investigation; a framework which proposes both the technology and processes that would allow social robot accidents to be investigated with no less rigour than we expect of air or rail accident investigations. The paper also places accident investigation within the practice of responsible robotics, and makes the case that social robotics without accident investigation would be no less irresponsible than aviation without air accident investigation."}
{"title":"Requirements and Technologies Towards UAM: Communication, Navigation, and Surveillance","abstract":"Urban air mobility (UAM) is a concept for creating an airborne transportation system that operates in urban settings with an on-board pilot and\/or remote pilot in command (RPIC), or with a fully autonomous architecture. Although the passenger traffic will be mostly in and near urban environments, UAM is also being considered for air cargo, perhaps between cities. Such capability is pushing the current communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) \/ air traffic management (ATM) systems that were not designed to support these types of aviation scenarios. The UAM aircraft will be operating in a congested environment, where CNS and ATM systems need to provide integrity, robustness, security, and very high availability for safety of UAM operations while evolving. As UAM is under research by academia and government agencies, the industry is driving technology towards aircraft prototypes. Critical UAM requirements are derived from command and control (C2) (particularly for RPIC scenario), data connectivity for passengers and flight systems, unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) to UAS communication to avoid collision, and data exchange for positioning and surveillance. In this paper, we study connectivity challenges and present requirements towards a robust UAM architecture through its concept of operations. In addition, we review the existing\/potential CNS technologies towards UAM, i.e., 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) fifth generation (5G) new radio (NR), navigation detect & avoid (DAA), and satellite systems and present conclusions on a future road-map for UAM CNS architecture."}
{"title":"Cost estimation for alternative aviation plans against potential radiation exposure associated with solar proton events for the airline industry","abstract":"We present a systematic approach to effectively evaluate potential risk cost caused by exposure to solar proton events (SPEs) from solar flares for the airline industry. We also evaluate associated health risks from radiation, to provide relevant alternative ways to minimize economic loss and opportunity. The estimated radiation dose induced by each SPE for the passengers of each flight is calculated using ExoKyoto and PHITS. We determine a few scenarios for the estimated dose limit at 1 and 20mSv, corresponding to the effective dose limit for the general public and occupational exposure, respectively, as well as a higher dose induced an extreme superflare. We set a hypothetical airline shutdown scenario at 1mSv for a single flight per passenger, due to legal restrictions under the potential radiation dose. In such a scenario, we calculate the potential loss in direct and opportunity cost under the cancelation of the flight. At the same time, we considered that, even under such a scenario, if the airplane flies at a slightly lower altitude (from 12 to 9.5km: atmospheric depth from 234 to 365g\/cm$^{2}$), the total loss becomes much smaller than flight cancelation, and the estimated total dose goes down from 1.2 to 0.45mSv, which is below the effective dose limit for the general public. In case of flying at an even lower altitude (7km: atmospheric depth 484g\/cm$^{2}$), the estimated total dose becomes much smaller, 0.12 mSv. If we assume the increase of fuel cost is proportional to the increase in atmospheric depth, the increase in cost becomes 1.56 and 2.07 for the case of flying at 9.5 km and at 7 km, respectively. Lower altitude flights provide more safety for the potential risk of radiation doses induced by severe SPEs. At the same time, since there is total loss caused by flight cancelation, we propose that considering lower flight altitude is the best protection against solar flares."}
{"title":"A Methodology for Automating Assurance Case Generation","abstract":"Safety Case has become an integral component for safety-certification in various Cyber Physical System domains including automotive, aviation, medical devices, and military. The certification processes for these systems are stringent and require robust safety assurance arguments and substantial evidence backing. Despite the strict requirements, current practices still rely on manual methods that are brittle, do not have a systematic approach or thorough consideration of sound arguments. In addition, stringent certification requirements and ever-increasing system complexity make ad-hoc, manual assurance case generation (ACG) inefficient, time consuming, and expensive. To improve the current state of practice, we introduce a structured ACG tool which uses system design artifacts, accumulated evidence, and developer expertise to construct a safety case and evaluate it in an automated manner. We also illustrate the applicability of the ACG tool on a remote-control car testbed case study."}
{"title":"Moving Fast and Breaking Things: How to stop crashing more than twice","abstract":"\"Moving fast, and breaking things\", instead of \"being safe and secure\", is the credo of the IT industry. In this paper, we take a look at how we keep falling for the same security issues, and what we can learn from aviation safety to learn building and operating IT systems securely. We find that computer security should adopt the idea of safety. This entails not only building systems that are operating as desired in the presence of an active attacker, but also building them in a way that they remain secure and operational in the presence of any failure. Furthermore, we propose a 'clean slate policy design' to counter the current state of verbose, hardly followed best practices, together with an incident handling and reporting structure similar to that found in aviation safety."}
{"title":"The Area of the Convex Hull of Sampled Curves: a Robust Functional Statistical Depth Measure","abstract":"With the ubiquity of sensors in the IoT era, statistical observations are becoming increasingly available in the form of massive (multivariate) time-series. Formulated as unsupervised anomaly detection tasks, an abundance of applications like aviation safety management, the health monitoring of complex infrastructures or fraud detection can now rely on such functional data, acquired and stored with an ever finer granularity. The concept of statistical depth, which reflects centrality of an arbitrary observation w.r.t. a statistical population may play a crucial role in this regard, anomalies corresponding to observations with 'small' depth. Supported by sound theoretical and computational developments in the recent decades, it has proven to be extremely useful, in particular in functional spaces. However, most approaches documented in the literature consist in evaluating independently the centrality of each point forming the time series and consequently exhibit a certain insensitivity to possible shape changes. In this paper, we propose a novel notion of functional depth based on the area of the convex hull of sampled curves, capturing gradual departures from centrality, even beyond the envelope of the data, in a natural fashion. We discuss practical relevance of commonly imposed axioms on functional depths and investigate which of them are satisfied by the notion of depth we promote here. Estimation and computational issues are also addressed and various numerical experiments provide empirical evidence of the relevance of the approach proposed."}
{"title":"The State of Modeling, Simulation, and Data Utilization within Industry: An Autonomous Vehicles Perspective","abstract":"The aviation industry has a market driven need to maintain and develop enhanced simulation capabilities for a wide range of application domains. In particular, the future growth and disruptive ability of smart cities, autonomous vehicles and in general, urban mobility, hinges on the development of state of the art simulation tools and the intelligent utilization of data. While aviation based companies have several historical and\/or proprietary mission level simulation tools, there is much to learn from the current state of the art within other industries (tangential and competing in scope), as well as in academia. The purpose of this paper is to address and decompose the simulation capabilities within the key players of the autonomous vehicle and self-driving car industry (Toyota, Waymo, BMW, Microsoft, NVIDIA, Uber, etc.), as well as several notable startups within the high fidelity 3D mapping and simulation domain (Mapper, HERE, Cognata, etc.). While providing an overview of how other companies are using simulation tools and reliable data-sets, this paper will also seek to address several important and related questions, namely: the interaction between simulation and supporting tools\/software, the intersection of simulation and the real world, the requirements and utilization of compute infrastructure, the appropriate levels of fidelity within simulation, and how simulation tools are critical to future safety and V&V concerns. In order for aviation based companies to adequately pursue disruptive mobility within real-world environments, be it in air or on the ground, modeling and simulation tools for autonomous vehicles provide key insights into future development work and are essential technologies."}
{"title":"ART: Abstraction Refinement-Guided Training for Provably Correct Neural Networks","abstract":"Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have demonstrated remarkable utility in various challenging machine learning applications. While formally verified properties of their behaviors are highly desired, they have proven notoriously difficult to derive and enforce. Existing approaches typically formulate this problem as a post facto analysis process. In this paper, we present a novel learning framework that ensures such formal guarantees are enforced by construction. Our technique enables training provably correct networks with respect to a broad class of safety properties, a capability that goes well-beyond existing approaches, without compromising much accuracy. Our key insight is that we can integrate an optimization-based abstraction refinement loop into the learning process and operate over dynamically constructed partitions of the input space that considers accuracy and safety objectives synergistically. The refinement procedure iteratively splits the input space from which training data is drawn, guided by the efficacy with which such partitions enable safety verification. We have implemented our approach in a tool (ART) and applied it to enforce general safety properties on unmanned aviator collision avoidance system ACAS Xu dataset and the Collision Detection dataset. Importantly, we empirically demonstrate that realizing safety does not come at the price of much accuracy. Our methodology demonstrates that an abstraction refinement methodology provides a meaningful pathway for building both accurate and correct machine learning networks."}
{"title":"Leveraging Reinforcement Learning Techniques for Effective Policy Adoption and Validation","abstract":"Rewards and punishments in different forms are pervasive and present in a wide variety of decision-making scenarios. By observing the outcome of a sufficient number of repeated trials, one would gradually learn the value and usefulness of a particular policy or strategy. However, in a given environment, the outcomes resulting from different trials are subject to chance influence and variations. In learning about the usefulness of a given policy, significant costs are involved in systematically undertaking the sequential trials; therefore, in most learning episodes, one would wish to keep the cost within bounds by adopting learning stopping rules. In this paper, we examine the deployment of different stopping strategies in given learning environments which vary from highly stringent for mission critical operations to highly tolerant for non-mission critical operations, and emphasis is placed on the former with particular application to aviation safety. In policy evaluation, two sequential phases of learning are identified, and we describe the outcomes variations using a probabilistic model, with closedform expressions obtained for the key measures of performance. Decision rules that map the trial observations to policy choices are also formulated. In addition, simulation experiments are performed, which corroborate the validity of the theoretical results."}
{"title":"Localization Requirements for Autonomous Vehicles","abstract":"Autonomous vehicles require precise knowledge of their position and orientation in all weather and traffic conditions for path planning, perception, control, and general safe operation. Here we derive these requirements for autonomous vehicles based on first principles. We begin with the safety integrity level, defining the allowable probability of failure per hour of operation based on desired improvements on road safety today. This draws comparisons with the localization integrity levels required in aviation and rail where similar numbers are derived at 10^-8 probability of failure per hour of operation. We then define the geometry of the problem, where the aim is to maintain knowledge that the vehicle is within its lane and to determine what road level it is on. Longitudinal, lateral, and vertical localization error bounds (alert limits) and 95% accuracy requirements are derived based on US road geometry standards (lane width, curvature, and vertical clearance) and allowable vehicle dimensions. For passenger vehicles operating on freeway roads, the result is a required lateral error bound of 0.57 m (0.20 m, 95%), a longitudinal bound of 1.40 m (0.48 m, 95%), a vertical bound of 1.30 m (0.43 m, 95%), and an attitude bound in each direction of 1.50 deg (0.51 deg, 95%). On local streets, the road geometry makes requirements more stringent where lateral and longitudinal error bounds of 0.29 m (0.10 m, 95%) are needed with an orientation requirement of 0.50 deg (0.17 deg, 95%)."}
{"title":"Autonomous Air Traffic Controller: A Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach","abstract":"Air traffic control is a real-time safety-critical decision making process in highly dynamic and stochastic environments. In today's aviation practice, a human air traffic controller monitors and directs many aircraft flying through its designated airspace sector. With the fast growing air traffic complexity in traditional (commercial airliners) and low-altitude (drones and eVTOL aircraft) airspace, an autonomous air traffic control system is needed to accommodate high density air traffic and ensure safe separation between aircraft. We propose a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that is able to identify and resolve conflicts between aircraft in a high-density, stochastic, and dynamic en-route sector with multiple intersections and merging points. The proposed framework utilizes an actor-critic model, A2C that incorporates the loss function from Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to help stabilize the learning process. In addition we use a centralized learning, decentralized execution scheme where one neural network is learned and shared by all agents in the environment. We show that our framework is both scalable and efficient for large number of incoming aircraft to achieve extremely high traffic throughput with safety guarantee. We evaluate our model via extensive simulations in the BlueSky environment. Results show that our framework is able to resolve 99.97% and 100% of all conflicts both at intersections and merging points, respectively, in extreme high-density air traffic scenarios."}
{"title":"Detecting ADS-B Spoofing Attacks using Deep Neural Networks","abstract":"The Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) system is a key component of the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) that manages the increasingly congested airspace. It provides accurate aircraft localization and efficient air traffic management and also improves the safety of billions of current and future passengers. While the benefits of ADS-B are well known, the lack of basic security measures like encryption and authentication introduces various exploitable security vulnerabilities. One practical threat is the ADS-B spoofing attack that targets the ADS-B ground station, in which the ground-based or aircraft-based attacker manipulates the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) address (a unique identifier for each aircraft) in the ADS-B messages to fake the appearance of non-existent aircraft or masquerade as a trusted aircraft. As a result, this attack can confuse the pilots or the air traffic control personnel and cause dangerous maneuvers. In this paper, we introduce SODA - a two-stage Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based spoofing detector for ADS-B that consists of a message classifier and an aircraft classifier. It allows a ground station to examine each incoming message based on the PHY-layer features (e.g., IQ samples and phases) and flag suspicious messages. Our experimental results show that SODA detects ground-based spoofing attacks with a probability of 99.34%, while having a very small false alarm rate (i.e., 0.43%). It outperforms other machine learning techniques such as XGBoost, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine. It further identifies individual aircraft with an average F-score of 96.68% and an accuracy of 96.66%, with a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art detector."}
{"title":"On the validation and use of high-fidelity numerical simulations for gust response analysis","abstract":"Specific gust response is considered as one of the most important loads encountered by an aircraft. The Certification Specification (CS) 25, defined by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), and the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) 25, defined by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), describe the critical gusts that an aircraft must withstand. They must be analyzed for a large range of flight points (Altitude and Equivalent Air speed) and mass configurations. For some load cases, the standard tools could not be accurate enough to correctly predict the gust response and the use of high-fidelity computation could be required. Therefore, ONERA has implemented in its in-house Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code elsA (ONERA-Airbus-Safran property) the capability to compute the high-fidelity aeroelastic gust response, directly in the time-domain, for different discrete gust shapes.This paper presents some recent work achieved at ONERA concerning high-fidelity simulations for gust response. First, a physical validation of the gust response simulation is performed by comparing the results to those obtained experimentally on a scaled model. Second, numerical comparisons are performed using various techniques, in order to model the gust. Finally, an application for generic regional aircraft is shown."}
{"title":"UAV Command and Control, Navigation and Surveillance: A Review of Potential 5G and Satellite Systems","abstract":"Drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or unmanned aerial systems (UAS) are expected to be an important component of 5G\/beyond 5G (B5G) communications. This includes their use within cellular architectures (5G UAVs), in which they can facilitate both wireless broadcast and point-to-point transmissions, usually using small UAS (sUAS). Allowing UAS to operate within airspace along with commercial, cargo, and other piloted aircraft will likely require dedicated and protected aviation spectrum at least in the near term, while regulatory authorities adapt to their use. The command and control (C2), or control and non-payload communications (CNPC) link provides safety critical information for the control of the UAV both in terrestrial-based line of sight (LOS) conditions and in satellite communication links for so-called beyond LOS (BLOS) conditions. In this paper, we provide an overview of these CNPC links as they may be used in 5G and satellite systems by describing basic concepts and challenges. We review new entrant technologies that might be used for UAV C2 as well as for payload communication, such as millimeter wave (mmWave) systems, and also review navigation and surveillance challenges. A brief discussion of UAV-to-UAV communication and hardware issues are also provided."}
{"title":"Towards a New Paradigm of UAV Safety","abstract":"With the rising popularity of UAVs in the civilian world, we are currently witnessing and paradim shift in terms of operational safety of flying vehicles. Safe and ubiquitous human-system interaction shall remain the core requirement but those prescribed in general aviation are not adapted for UAVs. Yet we believe it is possible to leverage the specific aspects of unmanned aviation to meet acceptable safety requirements. We start this paper with by discussing the new operational context of civilian UAVs and investigate the meaning of safety in light of this new context. Next, we explore the different approaches to ensuring system safety from an avionics point of view. Subsets of operational requirements such as geofencing or mechanical systems for termination or impact limitation can easily be implemented. These are presented with the goal of limiting the collateral damages of a system failure. We then present some experimental results regarding two of the major problems with UAVs. With actual impacts, we demonstrate how dangerous uncontrolled crashes can be. Furthermore, with the large number of runaway drone experiences during civilian operations, the risk is even higher as they can travel a long way before crashing. We provide data on such a case where the software controller is working, keeping the UAV in the air, but the operator is unable to actually control the system. It should be terminated! Finally, after having analyzed the context and some actual solutions, based on a minimal set of requirement and our own experience, we are proposing a simple mechanical based safety system. It unequivocally terminates the flight in the most efficient way by instantly removing parts of the propellers leaving a minimal lifting surface. It takes advantage of what controllability may remain but with a deterministic ending: a definite landing."}
{"title":"Efficient Clear Air Turbulence Avoidance Algorithms using IoT for Commercial Aviation","abstract":"With the growth of commercial aviation over the last few decades there have been many applications designed to improve the efficiency of flight operations as well as safety and security. A number of these applications are based on the gathered data from flights; the data is usually acquired from the various sensors available on the aircraft. There are numerous sensors among the electrical and electronics devices on an aircraft, most of which are essential for the proper functioning of the same. With the sensors being operational throughout the time of movement of the aircraft, a large amount of data is collected during each flight. Normally, most of the gathered data are stored on a storage device on the aircraft, and are analyzed and studied later off-site for research purposes focusing on improving airline operation and efficiently maintaining the same. In certain cases, when there is data transfer during the flight, it is between the aircraft and an air-traffic-control (ATC) tower, which serves as the base station. The aircraft equipped with all these sensors, which can gather and exchange data, form a framework of Internet of things (IoT). Detecting and avoiding any form of turbulence for an aircraft is vital; it adds to the safety of both passengers and aircraft while reducing the operating cost of the airline. Therefore, in this paper, we study techniques to detect and avoid Clear Air Turbulence (CAT), which is a specific type of turbulence, based on the IoT framework of aircraft. We propose algorithms that consider both direct and indirect communication between aircraft within a specific region. Using simulation results, we show that our proposed techniques of direct communication using the IoT framework is faster than conventional techniques involving radio communication via both single ATC tower and multiple ATC towers."}
{"title":"Improving Aviation Safety using Synthetic Vision System integrated with Eye-tracking Devices","abstract":"By collecting the data of eyeball movement of pilots, it is possible to monitor pilot's operation in the future flight in order to detect potential accidents. In this paper, we designed a novel SVS system that is integrated with an eye tracking device, and is able to achieve the following functions:1) A novel method that is able to learn from the eyeball movements of pilots and preload or render the terrain data in various resolutions, in order to improve the quality of terrain display by comprehending the interested regions of the pilot. 2) A warning mechanism that may detect the risky operation via analyzing the aviation information from the SVS and the eyeball movement from the eye tracking device, in order to prevent the maloperations or human factor accidents. The user study and experiments show that the proposed SVS-Eyetracking system works efficiently and is capable of avoiding potential risked caused by fatigue in the flight simulation."}
{"title":"Explaining Aviation Safety Incidents Using Deep Temporal Multiple Instance Learning","abstract":"Although aviation accidents are rare, safety incidents occur more frequently and require a careful analysis to detect and mitigate risks in a timely manner. Analyzing safety incidents using operational data and producing event-based explanations is invaluable to airline companies as well as to governing organizations such as the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States. However, this task is challenging because of the complexity involved in mining multi-dimensional heterogeneous time series data, the lack of time-step-wise annotation of events in a flight, and the lack of scalable tools to perform analysis over a large number of events. In this work, we propose a precursor mining algorithm that identifies events in the multidimensional time series that are correlated with the safety incident. Precursors are valuable to systems health and safety monitoring and in explaining and forecasting safety incidents. Current methods suffer from poor scalability to high dimensional time series data and are inefficient in capturing temporal behavior. We propose an approach by combining multiple-instance learning (MIL) and deep recurrent neural networks (DRNN) to take advantage of MIL's ability to learn using weakly supervised data and DRNN's ability to model temporal behavior. We describe the algorithm, the data, the intuition behind taking a MIL approach, and a comparative analysis of the proposed algorithm with baseline models. We also discuss the application to a real-world aviation safety problem using data from a commercial airline company and discuss the model's abilities and shortcomings, with some final remarks about possible deployment directions."}
{"title":"Airborne forward pointing UV Rayleigh lidar for remote clear air turbulence (CAT) detection: system design and performance","abstract":"A high-performance airborne UV Rayleigh lidar system was developed within the European project DELICAT. With its forward-pointing architecture it aims at demonstrating a novel detection scheme for clear air turbulence (CAT) for an aeronautics safety application. Due to its occurrence in clear and clean air at high altitudes (aviation cruise flight level), this type of turbulence evades microwave radar techniques and in most cases coherent Doppler lidar techniques. The present lidar detection technique relies on air density fluctuations measurement and is thus independent of backscatter from hydrometeors and aerosol particles. The subtle air density fluctuations caused by the turbulent air flow demand exceptionally high stability of the setup and in particular of the detection system. This paper describes an airborne test system for the purpose of demonstrating this technology and turbulence detection method: a high-power UV Rayleigh lidar system is installed on a research aircraft in a forward-looking configuration for use in cruise flight altitudes. Flight test measurements demonstrate this unique lidar system being able to resolve air density fluctuations occurring in light-to-moderate CAT at 5 km or moderate CAT at 10 km distance. A scaling of the determined stability and noise characteristics shows that such performance is adequate for an application in commercial air transport."}
{"title":"Measuring Water Vapor and Ash in Volcanic Eruptions with a Millimeter-Wave Radar\/Imager","abstract":"Millimeter-wave remote sensing technology can significantly improve measurements of volcanic eruptions, yielding new insights into eruption processes and improving forecasts of drifting volcanic ash for aviation safety. Radiometers can measure water vapor density and temperature inside eruption clouds, improving on existing measurements with infrared cameras that are limited to measuring the outer cloud surface. Millimeter-wave radar can measure the 3D mass distribution of volcanic ash inside eruption plumes and their nearby drifting ash clouds. Millimeter wavelengths are better matched to typical ash particle sizes, offering better sensitivity than longer wavelength existing weather radar measurements, as well as the unique ability to directly measure ash particle size in-situ. Here we present sensitivity calculations in the context of developing the WAMS (Water and Ash Millimeter-wave Spectrometer) instrument. WAMS, a radar\/radiometer system designed to use off-the-shelf components, would be able to measure water vapor and ash throughout an entire eruption cloud, a unique capability."}
{"title":"On Perception and Reality in Wireless Air Traffic Communications Security","abstract":"More than a dozen wireless technologies are used by air traffic communication systems during different flight phases. From a conceptual perspective, all of them are insecure as security was never part of their design. Recent contributions from academic and hacking communities have exploited this inherent vulnerability to demonstrate attacks on some of these technologies. However, not all of these contributions have resonated widely within aviation circles. At the same time, the security community lacks certain aviation domain knowledge, preventing aviation authorities from giving credence to their findings.\n  In this paper, we aim to reconcile the view of the security community and the perspective of aviation professionals concerning the safety of air traffic communication technologies. To achieve this, we first provide a systematization of the applications of wireless technologies upon which civil aviation relies. Based on these applications, we comprehensively analyze vulnerabilities, attacks, and countermeasures. We categorize the existing research on countermeasures into approaches that are applicable in the short term and research of secure new technologies deployable in the long term.\n  Since not all of the required aviation knowledge is codified in academic publications, we additionally examine existing aviation standards and survey 242 international aviation experts. Besides their domain knowledge, we also analyze the awareness of members of the aviation community concerning the security of wireless systems and collect their expert opinions on the potential impact of concrete attack scenarios using these technologies."}
{"title":"Semi-Markov Switching Vector Autoregressive Model-based Anomaly Detection in Aviation Systems","abstract":"In this work we consider the problem of anomaly detection in heterogeneous, multivariate, variable-length time series datasets. Our focus is on the aviation safety domain, where data objects are flights and time series are sensor readings and pilot switches. In this context the goal is to detect anomalous flight segments, due to mechanical, environmental, or human factors in order to identifying operationally significant events and provide insights into the flight operations and highlight otherwise unavailable potential safety risks and precursors to accidents. For this purpose, we propose a framework which represents each flight using a semi-Markov switching vector autoregressive (SMS-VAR) model. Detection of anomalies is then based on measuring dissimilarities between the model's prediction and data observation. The framework is scalable, due to the inherent parallel nature of most computations, and can be used to perform online anomaly detection. Extensive experimental results on simulated and real datasets illustrate that the framework can detect various types of anomalies along with the key parameters involved."}
{"title":"Sparse learning of maximum likelihood model for optimization of complex loss function","abstract":"Traditional machine learning methods usually minimize a simple loss function to learn a predictive model, and then use a complex performance measure to measure the prediction performance. However, minimizing a simple loss function cannot guarantee that an optimal performance. In this paper, we study the problem of optimizing the complex performance measure directly to obtain a predictive model. We proposed to construct a maximum likelihood model for this problem, and to learn the model parameter, we minimize a com- plex loss function corresponding to the desired complex performance measure. To optimize the loss function, we approximate the upper bound of the complex loss. We also propose impose the sparsity to the model parameter to obtain a sparse model. An objective is constructed by combining the upper bound of the loss function and the sparsity of the model parameter, and we develop an iterative algorithm to minimize it by using the fast iterative shrinkage- thresholding algorithm framework. The experiments on optimization on three different complex performance measures, including F-score, receiver operating characteristic curve, and recall precision curve break even point, over three real-world applications, aircraft event recognition of civil aviation safety, in- trusion detection in wireless mesh networks, and image classification, show the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods."}
{"title":"An experimental Study using ACSL and Frama-C to formulate and verify Low-Level Requirements from a DO-178C compliant Avionics Project","abstract":"Safety critical avionics software is a natural application area for formal verification. This is reflected in the formal method's inclusion into the certification guideline DO-178C and its formal methods supplement DO-333. Airbus and Dassault-Aviation, for example, have conducted studies in using formal verification. A large German national research project, Verisoft XT, also examined the application of formal methods in the avionics domain.\n  However, formal methods are not yet mainstream, and it is questionable if formal verification, especially formal deduction, can be integrated into the software development processes of a resource constrained small or medium enterprise (SME). ESG, a Munich based medium sized company, has conducted a small experimental study on the application of formal verification on a small portion of a real avionics project. The low level specification of a software function was formalized with ACSL, and the corresponding source code was partially verified using Frama-C and the WP plugin, with Alt-Ergo as automated prover.\n  We established a couple of criteria which a method should meet to be fit for purpose for industrial use in SME, and evaluated these criteria with the experience gathered by using ACSL with Frama-C on a real world example. The paper reports on the results of this study but also highlights some issues regarding the method in general which, in our view, will typically arise when using the method in the domain of embedded real-time programming."}
{"title":"Theory of ball lightning","abstract":"We present a comprehensive theory on the formation of ball lightning, a luminous sphere sometimes observed after normal lightning. In a ball lightning event, a relativistic electron bunch can be produced by the stepped leader of lightning and coherently emit high-power microwave when striking the ground. The intense microwave ionizes the local air and evacuates the resulting plasma by its radiation pressure, thereby forming a spherical plasma cavity that traps the microwave. The theory can explain observed properties of ball lightning and should be useful to lightning protection and aviation safety."}
{"title":"Grouped variable importance with random forests and application to multiple functional data analysis","abstract":"The selection of grouped variables using the random forest algorithm is considered. First a new importance measure adapted for groups of variables is proposed. Theoretical insights into this criterion are given for additive regression models. Second, an original method for selecting functional variables based on the grouped variable importance measure is developed. Using a wavelet basis, it is proposed to regroup all of the wavelet coefficients for a given functional variable and use a wrapper selection algorithm with these groups. Various other groupings which take advantage of the frequency and time localization of the wavelet basis are proposed. An extensive simulation study is performed to illustrate the use of the grouped importance measure in this context. The method is applied to a real life problem coming from aviation safety."}
{"title":"Cause Identification from Aviation Safety Incident Reports via Weakly Supervised Semantic Lexicon Construction","abstract":"The Aviation Safety Reporting System collects voluntarily submitted reports on aviation safety incidents to facilitate research work aiming to reduce such incidents. To effectively reduce these incidents, it is vital to accurately identify why these incidents occurred. More precisely, given a set of possible causes, or shaping factors, this task of cause identification involves identifying all and only those shaping factors that are responsible for the incidents described in a report. We investigate two approaches to cause identification. Both approaches exploit information provided by a semantic lexicon, which is automatically constructed via Thelen and Riloffs Basilisk framework augmented with our linguistic and algorithmic modifications. The first approach labels a report using a simple heuristic, which looks for the words and phrases acquired during the semantic lexicon learning process in the report. The second approach recasts cause identification as a text classification problem, employing supervised and transductive text classification algorithms to learn models from incident reports labeled with shaping factors and using the models to label unseen reports. Our experiments show that both the heuristic-based approach and the learning-based approach (when given sufficient training data) outperform the baseline system significantly."}
{"title":"Theoretical Foundation for Research in Communication using Information and Communication Technology Devices in Healthcare: An Interdisciplinary Scoping Review","abstract":"Faulty communication between team members is one of the most important factors preventing substantial improvement in patient safety. Aviation, nuclear power and defense have been able to improve their safety record by adopting theory and model based solutions. In contrast, healthcare's thrust towards modern communication devices is largely devoid of theoretical foundation. The objective of this scoping review is to compile communication theories, frameworks, and models used by high risk organizations outside healthcare to study and resolve workplace communication issues. The healthcare databases searched included Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycInfo. In addition, we searched engineering and science literature to include articles in the fields of information sciences, computer sciences, nuclear power generation, aviation, the military and other domains such as sociology that address the science and theory of communication. Comprehensive searching was also done in the communication studies literature. We also reviewed conference proceedings and grey literature and conducted citation tracking. Our initial systematic search yielded 15,365 articles. Hand searching and reviewing references resulted in a set of 181 articles. 144 full text articles were read and 40 of them were selected to be included in the review. We were able to identify 14 theories and 12 models which could be applied in hospital communication research. However, it must be noted that most of them have not yet been applied in biomedical research in hospital communication and as such their applicability can only be suggested-a gap which future research may be able to address. Formulation of a custom model representing the unique features and complexities of communication within hospitals is recommended."}
{"title":"Dynamic Logics of Dynamical Systems","abstract":"We survey dynamic logics for specifying and verifying properties of dynamical systems, including hybrid systems, distributed hybrid systems, and stochastic hybrid systems. A dynamic logic is a first-order modal logic with a pair of parametrized modal operators for each dynamical system to express necessary or possible properties of their transition behavior. Due to their full basis of first-order modal logic operators, dynamic logics can express a rich variety of system properties, including safety, controllability, reactivity, liveness, and quantified parametrized properties, even about relations between multiple dynamical systems. In this survey, we focus on some of the representatives of the family of differential dynamic logics, which share the ability to express properties of dynamical systems having continuous dynamics described by various forms of differential equations.\n  We explain the dynamical system models, dynamic logics of dynamical systems, their semantics, their axiomatizations, and proof calculi for proving logical formulas about these dynamical systems. We study differential invariants, i.e., induction principles for differential equations. We survey theoretical results, including soundness and completeness and deductive power. Differential dynamic logics have been implemented in automatic and interactive theorem provers and have been used successfully to verify safety-critical applications in automotive, aviation, railway, robotics, and analogue electrical circuits."}
{"title":"Performance comparison of pulse-pair and wavelets methods for the pulse Doppler weather radar spectrum","abstract":"In the civilian aviation field, the radar detection of hazardous weather phenomena (winds) is very important. This detection will allow the avoidance of these phenomena and consequently will enhance the safety of flights. In this work, we have used the wavelets method to estimate the mean velocity of winds. The results showed that the application of this method is promising compared with the classical estimators (pulse-pair, Fourier)."}
{"title":"Exploiting Real-Time FPGA Based Adaptive Systems Technology for Real-Time Sensor Fusion in Next Generation Automotive Safety Systems","abstract":"We present a system for the boresighting of sensors using inertial measurement devices as the basis for developing a range of dynamic real-time sensor fusion applications. The proof of concept utilizes a COTS FPGA platform for sensor fusion and real-time correction of a misaligned video sensor. We exploit a custom-designed 32-bit soft processor core and C-based design & synthesis for rapid, platform-neutral development. Kalman filter and sensor fusion techniques established in advanced aviation systems are applied to automotive vehicles with results exceeding typical industry requirements for sensor alignment. Results of the static and the dynamic tests demonstrate that using inexpensive accelerometers mounted on (or during assembly of) a sensor and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) fixed to a vehicle can be used to compute the misalignment of the sensor to the IMU and thus vehicle. In some cases the model predications and test results exceeded the requirements by an order of magnitude with a 3-sigma or 99% confidence."}
