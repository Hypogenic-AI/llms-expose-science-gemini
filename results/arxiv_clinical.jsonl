{"title":"TRACER: Transfer Learning based Real-time Adaptation for Clinical Evolving Risk","abstract":"Clinical decision support tools built on electronic health records often experience performance drift due to temporal population shifts, particularly when changes in the clinical environment initially affect only a subset of patients, resulting in a transition to mixed populations. Such case-mix changes commonly arise following system-level operational updates or the emergence of new diseases, such as COVID-19. We propose TRACER (Transfer Learning-based Real-time Adaptation for Clinical Evolving Risk), a framework that identifies encounter-level transition membership and adapts predictive models using transfer learning without full retraining. In simulation studies, TRACER outperformed static models trained on historical or contemporary data. In a real-world application predicting hospital admission following emergency department visits across the COVID-19 transition, TRACER improved both discrimination and calibration. TRACER provides a scalable approach for maintaining robust predictive performance under evolving and heterogeneous clinical conditions."}
{"title":"Building Patient Journeys in Hebrew: A Language Model for Clinical Timeline Extraction","abstract":"We present a new Hebrew medical language model designed to extract structured clinical timelines from electronic health records, enabling the construction of patient journeys. Our model is based on DictaBERT 2.0 and continually pre-trained on over five million de-identified hospital records. To evaluate its effectiveness, we introduce two new datasets -- one from internal medicine and emergency departments, and another from oncology -- annotated for event temporal relations. Our results show that our model achieves strong performance on both datasets. We also find that vocabulary adaptation improves token efficiency and that de-identification does not compromise downstream performance, supporting privacy-conscious model development. The model is made available for research use under ethical restrictions."}
{"title":"Boosted Random Forests for Predicting Treatment Failure of Chemotherapy Regimens","abstract":"Cancer patients may undergo lengthy and painful chemotherapy treatments, comprising several successive regimens or plans. Treatment inefficacy and other adverse events can lead to discontinuation (or failure) of these plans, or prematurely changing them, which results in a significant amount of physical, financial, and emotional toxicity to the patients and their families. In this work, we build treatment failure models based on the Real World Evidence (RWE) gathered from patients' profiles available in our oncology EMR\/EHR system. We also describe our feature engineering pipeline, experimental methods, and valuable insights obtained about treatment failures from trained models. We report our findings on five primary cancer types with the most frequent treatment failures (or discontinuations) to build unique and novel feature vectors from the clinical notes, diagnoses, and medications that are available in our oncology EMR. After following a novel three axes - performance, complexity and explainability - design exploration framework, boosted random forests are selected because they provide a baseline accuracy of 80% and an F1 score of 75%, with reduced model complexity, thus making them more interpretable to and usable by oncologists."}
{"title":"Toward an AI Reasoning-Enabled System for Patient-Clinical Trial Matching","abstract":"Screening patients for clinical trial eligibility remains a manual, time-consuming, and resource-intensive process. We present a secure, scalable proof-of-concept system for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-augmented patient-trial matching that addresses key implementation challenges: integrating heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data, facilitating expert review, and maintaining rigorous security standards. Leveraging open-source, reasoning-enabled large language models (LLMs), the system moves beyond binary classification to generate structured eligibility assessments with interpretable reasoning chains that support human-in-the-loop review. This decision support tool represents eligibility as a dynamic state rather than a fixed determination, identifying matches when available and offering actionable recommendations that could render a patient eligible in the future. The system aims to reduce coordinator burden, intelligently broaden the set of trials considered for each patient and guarantee comprehensive auditability of all AI-generated outputs."}
{"title":"ClinNoteAgents: An LLM Multi-Agent System for Predicting and Interpreting Heart Failure 30-Day Readmission from Clinical Notes","abstract":"Heart failure (HF) is one of the leading causes of rehospitalization among older adults in the United States. Although clinical notes contain rich, detailed patient information and make up a large portion of electronic health records (EHRs), they remain underutilized for HF readmission risk analysis. Traditional computational models for HF readmission often rely on expert-crafted rules, medical thesauri, and ontologies to interpret clinical notes, which are typically written under time pressure and may contain misspellings, abbreviations, and domain-specific jargon. We present ClinNoteAgents, an LLM-based multi-agent framework that transforms free-text clinical notes into (1) structured representations of clinical and social risk factors for association analysis and (2) clinician-style abstractions for HF 30-day readmission prediction. We evaluate ClinNoteAgents on 3,544 notes from 2,065 patients (readmission rate=35.16%), demonstrating strong performance in extracting risk factors from free-text, identifying key contributing factors, and predicting readmission risk. By reducing reliance on structured fields and minimizing manual annotation and model training, ClinNoteAgents provides a scalable and interpretable approach to note-based HF readmission risk modeling in data-limited healthcare systems."}
{"title":"Adaptive Test-Time Training for Predicting Need for Invasive Mechanical Ventilation in Multi-Center Cohorts","abstract":"Accurate prediction of the need for invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) in intensive care units (ICUs) patients is crucial for timely interventions and resource allocation. However, variability in patient populations, clinical practices, and electronic health record (EHR) systems across institutions introduces domain shifts that degrade the generalization performance of predictive models during deployment. Test-Time Training (TTT) has emerged as a promising approach to mitigate such shifts by adapting models dynamically during inference without requiring labeled target-domain data. In this work, we introduce Adaptive Test-Time Training (AdaTTT), an enhanced TTT framework tailored for EHR-based IMV prediction in ICU settings. We begin by deriving information-theoretic bounds on the test-time prediction error and demonstrate that it is constrained by the uncertainty between the main and auxiliary tasks. To enhance their alignment, we introduce a self-supervised learning framework with pretext tasks: reconstruction and masked feature modeling optimized through a dynamic masking strategy that emphasizes features critical to the main task. Additionally, to improve robustness against domain shifts, we incorporate prototype learning and employ Partial Optimal Transport (POT) for flexible, partial feature alignment while maintaining clinically meaningful patient representations. Experiments across multi-center ICU cohorts demonstrate competitive classification performance on different test-time adaptation benchmarks."}
{"title":"Deep learning for autism detection using clinical notes: A comparison of transfer learning for a transparent and black-box approach","abstract":"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition whose rising prevalence places increasing demands on a lengthy diagnostic process. Machine learning (ML) has shown promise in automating ASD diagnosis, but most existing models operate as black boxes and are typically trained on a single dataset, limiting their generalizability. In this study, we introduce a transparent and interpretable ML approach that leverages BioBERT, a state-of-the-art language model, to analyze unstructured clinical text. The model is trained to label descriptions of behaviors and map them to diagnostic criteria, which are then used to assign a final label (ASD or not). We evaluate transfer learning, the ability to transfer knowledge to new data, using two distinct real-world datasets. We trained on datasets sequentially and mixed together and compared the performance of the best models and their ability to transfer to new data. We also created a black-box approach and repeated this transfer process for comparison. Our transparent model demonstrated robust performance, with the mixed-data training strategy yielding the best results (97 % sensitivity, 98 % specificity). Sequential training across datasets led to a slight drop in performance, highlighting the importance of training data order. The black-box model performed worse (90 % sensitivity, 96 % specificity) when trained sequentially or with mixed data. Overall, our transparent approach outperformed the black-box approach. Mixing datasets during training resulted in slightly better performance and should be the preferred approach when practically possible. This work paves the way for more trustworthy, generalizable, and clinically actionable AI tools in neurodevelopmental diagnostics."}
{"title":"EXR: An Interactive Immersive EHR Visualization in Extended Reality","abstract":"This paper presents the design and implementation of an Extended Reality (XR) platform for immersive, interactive visualization of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The system extends beyond conventional 2D interfaces by visualizing both structured and unstructured patient data into a shared 3D environment, enabling intuitive exploration and real-time collaboration. The modular infrastructure integrates FHIR-based EHR data with volumetric medical imaging and AI-generated segmentation, ensuring interoperability with modern healthcare systems. The platform's capabilities are demonstrated using synthetic EHR datasets and computed tomography (CT)-derived spine models processed through an AI-powered segmentation pipeline. This work suggests that such integrated XR solutions could form the foundation for next-generation clinical decision-support tools, where advanced data infrastructures are directly accessible in an interactive and spatially rich environment."}
{"title":"Sepsis Prediction Using Graph Convolutional Networks over Patient-Feature-Value Triplets","abstract":"In the intensive care setting, sepsis continues to be a major contributor to patient illness and death; however, its timely detection is hindered by the complex, sparse, and heterogeneous nature of electronic health record (EHR) data. We propose Triplet-GCN, a single-branch graph convolutional model that represents each encounter as patient-feature-value triplets, constructs a bipartite EHR graph, and learns patient embeddings via a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) followed by a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). The pipeline applies type-specific preprocessing -- median imputation and standardization for numeric variables, effect coding for binary features, and mode imputation with low-dimensional embeddings for rare categorical attributes -- and initializes patient nodes with summary statistics, while retaining measurement values on edges to preserve \"who measured what and by how much\". In a retrospective, multi-center Chinese cohort (N = 648; 70\/30 train-test split) drawn from three tertiary hospitals, Triplet-GCN consistently outperforms strong tabular baselines (KNN, SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) across discrimination and balanced error metrics, yielding a more favorable sensitivity-specificity trade-off and improved overall utility for early warning. These findings indicate that encoding EHR as triplets and propagating information over a patient-feature graph produce more informative patient representations than feature-independent models, offering a simple, end-to-end blueprint for deployable sepsis risk stratification."}
{"title":"Enhancing Clinical Note Generation with ICD-10, Clinical Ontology Knowledge Graphs, and Chain-of-Thought Prompting Using GPT-4","abstract":"In the past decade a surge in the amount of electronic health record (EHR) data in the United States, attributed to a favorable policy environment created by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act of 2009 and the 21st Century Cures Act of 2016. Clinical notes for patients' assessments, diagnoses, and treatments are captured in these EHRs in free-form text by physicians, who spend a considerable amount of time entering and editing them. Manually writing clinical notes takes a considerable amount of a doctor's valuable time, increasing the patient's waiting time and possibly delaying diagnoses. Large language models (LLMs) possess the ability to generate news articles that closely resemble human-written ones. We investigate the usage of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt engineering to improve the LLM's response in clinical note generation. In our prompts, we use as input International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and basic patient information. We investigate a strategy that combines the traditional CoT with semantic search results to improve the quality of generated clinical notes. Additionally, we infuse a knowledge graph (KG) built from clinical ontology to further enrich the domain-specific knowledge of generated clinical notes. We test our prompting technique on six clinical cases from the CodiEsp test dataset using GPT-4 and our results show that it outperformed the clinical notes generated by standard one-shot prompts."}
{"title":"Rethinking Tokenization for Clinical Time Series: When Less is More","abstract":"Tokenization strategies shape how models process electronic health records, yet fair comparisons of their effectiveness remain limited. We present a systematic evaluation of tokenization approaches for clinical time series modeling using transformer-based architectures, revealing task-dependent and sometimes counterintuitive findings about temporal and value feature importance. Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters. Larger clinical encoders provide consistent improvements across tasks, benefiting from frozen embeddings that eliminate computational overhead. Our controlled evaluation enables fairer tokenization comparisons and demonstrates that simpler, parameter-efficient approaches can, in many cases, achieve strong performance, though the optimal tokenization strategy remains task-dependent."}
{"title":"Coefficient of Variation Masking: A Volatility-Aware Strategy for EHR Foundation Models","abstract":"Masked autoencoders (MAEs) are increasingly applied to electronic health records (EHR) for learning general-purpose representations that support diverse clinical tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies. Experiments on a large panel of laboratory tests show that CV-Masking enhances reconstruction, improves downstream predictive performance, and accelerates convergence, producing more robust and clinically meaningful EHR representations."}
{"title":"Are LLMs Truly Multilingual? Exploring Zero-Shot Multilingual Capability of LLMs for Information Retrieval: An Italian Healthcare Use Case","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a key topic in AI and NLP, transforming sectors like healthcare, finance, education, and marketing by improving customer service, automating tasks, providing insights, improving diagnostics, and personalizing learning experiences. Information extraction from clinical records is a crucial task in digital healthcare. Although traditional NLP techniques have been used for this in the past, they often fall short due to the complexity, variability of clinical language, and high inner semantics in the free clinical text. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a powerful tool for better understanding and generating human-like text, making them highly effective in this area. In this paper, we explore the ability of open-source multilingual LLMs to understand EHRs (Electronic Health Records) in Italian and help extract information from them in real-time. Our detailed experimental campaign on comorbidity extraction from EHR reveals that some LLMs struggle in zero-shot, on-premises settings, and others show significant variation in performance, struggling to generalize across various diseases when compared to native pattern matching and manual annotations."}
{"title":"UW-BioNLP at ChemoTimelines 2025: Thinking, Fine-Tuning, and Dictionary-Enhanced LLM Systems for Chemotherapy Timeline Extraction","abstract":"The ChemoTimelines shared task benchmarks methods for constructing timelines of systemic anticancer treatment from electronic health records of cancer patients. This paper describes our methods, results, and findings for subtask 2 -- generating patient chemotherapy timelines from raw clinical notes. We evaluated strategies involving chain-of-thought thinking, supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimization, and dictionary-based lookup to improve timeline extraction. All of our approaches followed a two-step workflow, wherein an LLM first extracted chemotherapy events from individual clinical notes, and then an algorithm normalized and aggregated events into patient-level timelines. Each specific method differed in how the associated LLM was utilized and trained. Multiple approaches yielded competitive performances on the test set leaderboard, with fine-tuned Qwen3-14B achieving the best official score of 0.678. Our results and analyses could provide useful insights for future attempts on this task as well as the design of similar tasks."}
{"title":"SmartAlert: Implementing Machine Learning-Driven Clinical Decision Support for Inpatient Lab Utilization Reduction","abstract":"Repetitive laboratory testing unlikely to yield clinically useful information is a common practice that burdens patients and increases healthcare costs. Education and feedback interventions have limited success, while general test ordering restrictions and electronic alerts impede appropriate clinical care. We introduce and evaluate SmartAlert, a machine learning (ML)-driven clinical decision support (CDS) system integrated into the electronic health record that predicts stable laboratory results to reduce unnecessary repeat testing. This case study describes the implementation process, challenges, and lessons learned from deploying SmartAlert targeting complete blood count (CBC) utilization in a randomized controlled pilot across 9270 admissions in eight acute care units across two hospitals between August 15, 2024, and March 15, 2025. Results show significant decrease in number of CBC results within 52 hours of SmartAlert display (1.54 vs 1.82, p <0.01) without adverse effect on secondary safety outcomes, representing a 15% relative reduction in repetitive testing. Implementation lessons learned include interpretation of probabilistic model predictions in clinical contexts, stakeholder engagement to define acceptable model behavior, governance processes for deploying a complex model in a clinical environment, user interface design considerations, alignment with clinical operational priorities, and the value of qualitative feedback from end users. In conclusion, a machine learning-driven CDS system backed by a deliberate implementation and governance process can provide precision guidance on inpatient laboratory testing to safely reduce unnecessary repetitive testing."}
{"title":"Training and Evaluation of Guideline-Based Medical Reasoning in LLMs","abstract":"Machine learning for early prediction in medicine has recently shown breakthrough performance, however, the focus on improving prediction accuracy has led to a neglect of faithful explanations that are required to gain the trust of medical practitioners. The goal of this paper is to teach LLMs to follow medical consensus guidelines step-by-step in their reasoning and prediction process. Since consensus guidelines are ubiquitous in medicine, instantiations of verbalized medical inference rules to electronic health records provide data for fine-tuning LLMs to learn consensus rules and possible exceptions thereof for many medical areas. Consensus rules also enable an automatic evaluation of the model's inference process regarding its derivation correctness (evaluating correct and faithful deduction of a conclusion from given premises) and value correctness (comparing predicted values against real-world measurements). We exemplify our work using the complex Sepsis-3 consensus definition. Our experiments show that small fine-tuned models outperform one-shot learning of considerably larger LLMs that are prompted with the explicit definition and models that are trained on medical texts including consensus definitions. Since fine-tuning on verbalized rule instantiations of a specific medical area yields nearly perfect derivation correctness for rules (and exceptions) on unseen patient data in that area, the bottleneck for early prediction is not out-of-distribution generalization, but the orthogonal problem of generalization into the future by forecasting sparsely and irregularly sampled clinical variables. We show that the latter results can be improved by integrating the output representations of a time series forecasting model with the LLM in a multimodal setup."}
{"title":"Associating Healthcare Teamwork with Patient Outcomes for Predictive Analysis","abstract":"Cancer treatment outcomes are influenced not only by clinical and demographic factors but also by the collaboration of healthcare teams. However, prior work has largely overlooked the potential role of human collaboration in shaping patient survival. This paper presents an applied AI approach to uncovering the impact of healthcare professionals' (HCPs) collaboration-captured through electronic health record (EHR) systems-on cancer patient outcomes. We model EHR-mediated HCP interactions as networks and apply machine learning techniques to detect predictive signals of patient survival embedded in these collaborations. Our models are cross validated to ensure generalizability, and we explain the predictions by identifying key network traits associated with improved outcomes. Importantly, clinical experts and literature validate the relevance of the identified crucial collaboration traits, reinforcing their potential for real-world applications. This work contributes to a practical workflow for leveraging digital traces of collaboration and AI to assess and improve team-based healthcare. The approach is potentially transferable to other domains involving complex collaboration and offers actionable insights to support data-informed interventions in healthcare delivery."}
{"title":"COPE: Chain-Of-Thought Prediction Engine for Open-Source Large Language Model Based Stroke Outcome Prediction from Clinical Notes","abstract":"Predicting outcomes in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) guides clinical decision-making, patient counseling, and resource allocation. Clinical notes contain rich contextual information, but their unstructured nature limits their use in traditional predictive models. We developed and evaluated the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Outcome Prediction Engine (COPE), a reasoning-enhanced large language model framework, for predicting 90-day functional outcomes after AIS from unstructured clinical notes. This study included 464 AIS patients with discharge summaries and 90-day modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores. COPE uses a two-step CoT framework based on sequential open-source LLaMA-3-8B models: the first generates clinical reasoning, and the second outputs an mRS prediction. We compared COPE with GPT-4.1, ClinicalBERT, a structured variable-based machine learning model (Clinical ML), and a single-step LLM without CoT. Performance was evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), accuracy within +\/-1 mRS point, and exact accuracy. COPE achieved an MAE of 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11), +\/-1 accuracy of 74.4% (69.9, 78.8%), and exact accuracy of 32.8% (28.0, 37.6%), comparable to GPT-4.1 and superior to ClinicalBERT [MAE 1.24 (1.13-1.36)], Clinical ML [1.28 (1.18-1.39)], and the single-step LLM [1.20 (1.09-1.33)]. Subgroup analyses showed consistent performance across sex and age, with slightly higher error among older patients, those undergoing thrombectomy, and those with longer summaries. These findings demonstrate that COPE, a lightweight, interpretable, and privacy-preserving open-source framework, provides an accurate and practical solution for outcome prediction from unstructured clinical text."}
{"title":"A discomfort-informed adaptive Gibbs sampler for finite mixture models","abstract":"Finite mixture models are frequently used to uncover latent structures in high-dimensional datasets (e.g.\\ identifying clusters of patients in electronic health records). The inference of such structures can be performed in a Bayesian framework, and involves the use of sampling algorithms such as Gibbs samplers aimed at deriving posterior distribution of the probabilities of observations to belong to specific clusters. Unfortunately, traditional implementations of Gibbs samplers in this context often face critical challenges, such as inefficient use of computational resources and unnecessary updates for observations that are highly likely to remain in their current cluster. This paper introduces a new adaptive Gibbs sampler that improves the convergence efficiency over existing methods. In particular, our sampler is guided by a function that, at each iteration, uses the past of the chain to focus the updating on observations potentially misclassified in the current clustering, i.e.\\ those with a low probability of belonging to their current component. Through simulation studies and two real data analyses, we empirically demonstrate that, in terms of convergence time, our method tends to perform more efficiently compared to state-of-the-art approaches."}
{"title":"Knowledge Graph Augmented Large Language Models for Disease Prediction","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) support powerful clinical prediction models, but existing methods typically provide coarse, post hoc explanations that offer limited value for patient-level decision making. We introduce a knowledge graph (KG)-guided chain-of-thought (CoT) framework that generates clinically grounded and temporally consistent reasoning for visit-level disease prediction in MIMIC-III. ICD-9 codes are mapped to PrimeKG, from which disease-relevant nodes and multi-hop reasoning paths are extracted and used as scaffolds for CoT generation; only explanations whose conclusions match observed outcomes are retained. Lightweight LLaMA-3.1-Instruct-8B and Gemma-7B models are then fine-tuned on this supervision corpus. Across ten PrimeKG-mapped diseases and limited training cohorts (400 and 1000 cases), KG-guided models outperform strong classical baselines, achieving AUROC values of 0.66 to 0.70 and macro-AUPR values of 0.40 to 0.47. The models also transfer zero-shot to the CRADLE cohort, improving accuracy from approximately 0.40 to 0.51 up to 0.72 to 0.77. A blinded clinician evaluation shows consistent preference for KG-guided CoT explanations in clarity, relevance, and clinical correctness."}
{"title":"A Hierarchical Computer Vision Pipeline for Physiological Data Extraction from Bedside Monitors","abstract":"In many low-resource healthcare settings, bedside monitors remain standalone legacy devices without network connectivity, creating a persistent interoperability gap that prevents seamless integration of physiological data into electronic health record (EHR) systems. To address this challenge without requiring costly hardware replacement, we present a computer vision-based pipeline for the automated capture and digitisation of vital sign data directly from bedside monitor screens. Our method employs a hierarchical detection framework combining YOLOv11 for accurate monitor and region of interest (ROI) localisation with PaddleOCR for robust text extraction. To enhance reliability across variable camera angles and lighting conditions, a geometric rectification module standardizes the screen perspective before character recognition. We evaluated the system on a dataset of 6,498 images collected from open-source corpora and real-world intensive care units in Vietnam. The model achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP@50-95) of 99.5% for monitor detection and 91.5% for vital sign ROI localisation. The end-to-end extraction accuracy exceeded 98.9% for core physiological parameters, including heart rate, oxygen saturation SpO2, and arterial blood pressure. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, camera-based approach can reliably transform unstructured information from screen captures into structured digital data, providing a practical and scalable pathway to improve information accessibility and clinical documentation in low-resource settings."}

The system will use a multi-layer structure; it will include an Application and Interface Layer, an Agents Layer, and a Data Source Layer to provide adaptive, transparent, and inclusive support. Fundamentally, a hybrid reasoning engine will synchronize four special-purpose agents, which include: a personalized-nutrition-based, called a Meal Planner Agent; an adaptive-scheduling-based, called a Reminder Agent; interactive assistance during grocery shopping and cooking, called a Food Guidance Agent; and a continuous-intake-and-physiological-tracking, called a Monitoring Agent. All the agents interact through a central communicative system called the Blackboard\/Event Bus, which allows autonomous interaction and real-time feedback loops with multimedia user interfaces. Privacy-sensitive data sources, including electronic health records (EHRs), nutritional databases, wearable sensors, and smart kitchen Internet of Things, are also included in the framework and placed into a policy-controlled layer, which ensures data safety and compliance with consent. Collaborative care and clinician dashboards allow common supervision, and discussable artificial intelligence (XAI) modules give brief explanations of why a decision was made, making users responsible and reliant. The proposed agentic AI framework is an extension beyond traditional assistive systems since it incorporates inclusiveness, personalization, and accessibility at all levels. It displays the intersection of multi-agent reasoning, multi-modal interfaces, and human-centered design that will enable the development of autonomy, health, and digital equity among people with disabilities and neurodivergence."}
{"title":"Early Risk Prediction with Temporally and Contextually Grounded Clinical Language Processing","abstract":"Clinical notes in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) capture rich temporal information on events, clinician reasoning, and lifestyle factors often missing from structured data. Leveraging them for predictive modeling can be impactful for timely identification of chronic diseases. However, they present core natural language processing (NLP) challenges: long text, irregular event distribution, complex temporal dependencies, privacy constraints, and resource limitations. We present two complementary methods for temporally and contextually grounded risk prediction from longitudinal notes. First, we introduce HiTGNN, a hierarchical temporal graph neural network that integrates intra-note temporal event structures, inter-visit dynamics, and medical knowledge to model patient trajectories with fine-grained temporal granularity. Second, we propose ReVeAL, a lightweight, test-time framework that distills the reasoning of large language models into smaller verifier models. Applied to opportunistic screening for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) using temporally realistic cohorts curated from private and public hospital corpora, HiTGNN achieves the highest predictive accuracy, especially for near-term risk, while preserving privacy and limiting reliance on large proprietary models. ReVeAL enhances sensitivity to true T2D cases and retains explanatory reasoning. Our ablations confirm the value of temporal structure and knowledge augmentation, and fairness analysis shows HiTGNN performs more equitably across subgroups."}
{"title":"Evaluating Strategies for Synthesizing Clinical Notes for Medical Multimodal AI","abstract":"Multimodal (MM) learning is emerging as a promising paradigm in biomedical artificial intelligence (AI) applications, integrating complementary modality, which highlight different aspects of patient health. The scarcity of large heterogeneous biomedical MM data has restrained the development of robust models for medical AI applications. In the dermatology domain, for instance, skin lesion datasets typically include only images linked to minimal metadata describing the condition, thereby limiting the benefits of MM data integration for reliable and generalizable predictions. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the synthesis of textual description of image findings, potentially allowing the combination of image and text representations. However, LLMs are not specifically trained for use in the medical domain, and their naive inclusion has raised concerns about the risk of hallucinations in clinically relevant contexts. This work investigates strategies for generating synthetic textual clinical notes, in terms of prompt design and medical metadata inclusion, and evaluates their impact on MM architectures toward enhancing performance in classification and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Experiments across several heterogeneous dermatology datasets demonstrate that synthetic clinical notes not only enhance classification performance, particularly under domain shift, but also unlock cross-modal retrieval capabilities, a downstream task that is not explicitly optimized during training."}
{"title":"Machine Learning Approaches to Clinical Risk Prediction: Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment in Electronic Health Records","abstract":"This study proposes a risk prediction method based on a Multi-Scale Temporal Alignment Network (MSTAN) to address the challenges of temporal irregularity, sampling interval differences, and multi-scale dynamic dependencies in Electronic Health Records (EHR). The method focuses on temporal feature modeling by introducing a learnable temporal alignment mechanism and a multi-scale convolutional feature extraction structure to jointly model long-term trends and short-term fluctuations in EHR sequences. At the input level, the model maps multi-source clinical features into a unified high-dimensional semantic space and employs temporal embedding and alignment modules to dynamically weight irregularly sampled data, reducing the impact of temporal distribution differences on model performance. The multi-scale feature extraction module then captures key patterns across different temporal granularities through multi-layer convolution and hierarchical fusion, achieving a fine-grained representation of patient states. Finally, an attention-based aggregation mechanism integrates global temporal dependencies to generate individual-level risk representations for disease risk prediction and health status assessment. Experiments conducted on publicly available EHR datasets show that the proposed model outperforms mainstream baselines in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of multi-scale temporal alignment in complex medical time-series analysis. This study provides a new solution for intelligent representation of high-dimensional asynchronous medical sequences and offers important technical support for EHR-driven clinical risk prediction."}
{"title":"Medical Test-free Disease Detection Based on Big Data","abstract":"Accurate disease detection is of paramount importance for effective medical treatment and patient care. However, the process of disease detection is often associated with extensive medical testing and considerable costs, making it impractical to perform all possible medical tests on a patient to diagnose or predict hundreds or thousands of diseases. In this work, we propose Collaborative Learning for Disease Detection (CLDD), a novel graph-based deep learning model that formulates disease detection as a collaborative learning task by exploiting associations among diseases and similarities among patients adaptively. CLDD integrates patient-disease interactions and demographic features from electronic health records to detect hundreds or thousands of diseases for every patient, with little to no reliance on the corresponding medical tests. Extensive experiments on a processed version of the MIMIC-IV dataset comprising 61,191 patients and 2,000 diseases demonstrate that CLDD consistently outperforms representative baselines across multiple metrics, achieving a 6.33\\% improvement in recall and 7.63\\% improvement in precision. Furthermore, case studies on individual patients illustrate that CLDD can successfully recover masked diseases within its top-ranked predictions, demonstrating both interpretability and reliability in disease prediction. By reducing diagnostic costs and improving accessibility, CLDD holds promise for large-scale disease screening and social health security."}
{"title":"A Fast and Efficient Modern BERT based Text-Conditioned Diffusion Model for Medical Image Segmentation","abstract":"In recent times, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have proven effective for medical image generation and denoising, and as representation learners for downstream segmentation. However, segmentation performance is limited by the need for dense pixel-wise labels, which are expensive, time-consuming, and require expert knowledge. We propose FastTextDiff, a label-efficient diffusion-based segmentation model that integrates medical text annotations to enhance semantic representations. Our approach uses ModernBERT, a transformer capable of processing long clinical notes, to tightly link textual annotations with semantic content in medical images. Trained on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, ModernBERT encodes clinical knowledge that guides cross-modal attention between visual and textual features. This study validates ModernBERT as a fast, scalable alternative to Clinical BioBERT in diffusion-based segmentation pipelines and highlights the promise of multi-modal techniques for medical image analysis. By replacing Clinical BioBERT with ModernBERT, FastTextDiff benefits from FlashAttention 2, an alternating attention mechanism, and a 2-trillion-token corpus, improving both segmentation accuracy and training efficiency over traditional diffusion-based models."}
{"title":"Generating Querying Code from Text for Multi-Modal Electronic Health Record","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHR) contain extensive structured and unstructured data, including tabular information and free-text clinical notes. Querying relevant patient information often requires complex database operations, increasing the workload for clinicians. However, complex table relationships and professional terminology in EHRs limit the query accuracy. In this work, we construct a publicly available dataset, TQGen, that integrates both \\textbf{T}ables and clinical \\textbf{T}ext for natural language-to-query \\textbf{Gen}eration. To address the challenges posed by complex medical terminology and diverse types of questions in EHRs, we propose TQGen-EHRQuery, a framework comprising a medical knowledge module and a questions template matching module. For processing medical text, we introduced the concept of a toolset, which encapsulates the text processing module as a callable tool, thereby improving processing efficiency and flexibility. We conducted extensive experiments to assess the effectiveness of our dataset and workflow, demonstrating their potential to enhance information querying in EHR systems."}
{"title":"Discovering Spatial Patterns of Readmission Risk Using a Bayesian Competing Risks Model with Spatially Varying Coefficients","abstract":"Time-to-event models are commonly used to study associations between risk factors and disease outcomes in the setting of electronic health records (EHR). In recent years, focus has intensified on social determinants of health, highlighting the need for methods that account for patients' locations. We propose a Bayesian approach for introducing point-referenced spatial effects into a competing risks proportional hazards model. Our method leverages Gaussian process (GP) priors for spatially varying intercept and slope. To improve computational efficiency under a large number of spatial locations, we implemented a Hilbert space low-rank approximation of the GP. We modeled the baseline hazard curves as piecewise constant, and introduced a novel multiplicative gamma process prior to induce shrinkage and smoothing. A loss-based clustering method was then used on the spatial random effects to identify high-risk regions. We demonstrate the utility of this method through simulation and a real-world analysis of EHR data from Duke Hospital to study readmission risk of elderly patients with upper extremity fractures. Our results showed that the proposed method improved inference efficiency and provided valuable insights for downstream policy decisions."}
{"title":"Schema Matching on Graph: Iterative Graph Exploration for Efficient and Explainable Data Integration","abstract":"Schema matching is a critical task in data integration, particularly in the medical domain where disparate Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems must be aligned to standard models like OMOP CDM. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in schema matching, they suffer from hallucination and lack of up-to-date domain knowledge. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution by providing structured, verifiable knowledge. However, existing KG-augmented LLM approaches often rely on inefficient complex multi-hop queries or storage-intensive vector-based retrieval methods. This paper introduces SMoG (Schema Matching on Graph), a novel framework that leverages iterative execution of simple 1-hop SPARQL queries, inspired by successful strategies in Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). SMoG enhances explainability and reliability by generating human-verifiable query paths while significantly reducing storage requirements by directly querying SPARQL endpoints. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that SMoG achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness and efficiency in KG-augmented schema matching."}
{"title":"Clarifying Trinko as Precedent in EHR and AI Memory Duty to Deal Cases: A New Institutional Economics Approach","abstract":"By clarifying the bases for the Verizon Communications Inc. v. Law Offices of Curtis V. Trinko, LLP, 2004 opinion, we hope to reduce two distinct errors. The false positive error is citing Trinko as precedent when it is not. This error is so prevalent it has earned the nickname of Trinko Creep. The false negative error is not citing Trinko when it should be. We argue that this error will be growing in the future as Trinko should be precedent in cases involving regulated access rights to sensitive consumer data in electronic health records and Agentic AI Long Term Memory."}
{"title":"Towards Robust and Fair Next Visit Diagnosis Prediction under Noisy Clinical Notes with Large Language Models","abstract":"A decade of rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for clinical decision support systems (CDSS), with large language models (LLMs) demonstrating strong reasoning abilities on timely medical tasks. However, clinical texts are often degraded by human errors or failures in automated pipelines, raising concerns about the reliability and fairness of AI-assisted decision-making. Yet the impact of such degradations remains under-investigated, particularly regarding how noise-induced shifts can heighten predictive uncertainty and unevenly affect demographic subgroups. We present a systematic study of state-of-the-art LLMs under diverse text corruption scenarios, focusing on robustness and equity in next-visit diagnosis prediction. To address the challenge posed by the large diagnostic label space, we introduce a clinically grounded label-reduction scheme and a hierarchical chain-of-thought (CoT) strategy that emulates clinicians' reasoning. Our approach improves robustness and reduces subgroup instability under degraded inputs, advancing the reliable use of LLMs in CDSS. We release code at https:\/\/github.com\/heejkoo9\/NECHOv3."}
{"title":"A Patient-Centric Blockchain Framework for Secure Electronic Health Record Management: Decoupling Data Storage from Access Control","abstract":"We present a patient-centric architecture for electronic health record (EHR) sharing that separates content storage from authorization and audit. Encrypted FHIR resources are stored off-chain; a public blockchain records only cryptographic commitments and patient-signed, time-bounded permissions using EIP-712. Keys are distributed via public-key wrapping, enabling storage providers to remain honest-but-curious without risking confidentiality. We formalize security goals (confidentiality, integrity, cryptographically attributable authorization, and auditability of authorization events) and provide a Solidity reference implementation deployed as single-patient contracts. On-chain costs for permission grants average 78,000 gas (L1), and end-to-end access latency for 1 MB records is 0.7--1.4s (mean values for S3 and IPFS respectively), dominated by storage retrieval. Layer-2 deployment reduces gas usage by 10--13x, though data availability charges dominate actual costs. We discuss metadata privacy, key registry requirements, and regulatory considerations (HIPAA\/GDPR), demonstrating a practical route to restoring patient control while preserving security properties required for sensitive clinical data."}
{"title":"Patient-level Information Extraction by Consistent Integration of Textual and Tabular Evidence with Bayesian Networks","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) form an invaluable resource for training clinical decision support systems. To leverage the potential of such systems in high-risk applications, we need large, structured tabular datasets on which we can build transparent feature-based models. While part of the EHR already contains structured information (e.g. diagnosis codes, medications, and lab results), much of the information is contained within unstructured text (e.g. discharge summaries and nursing notes). In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge."}
{"title":"Analysis of heart failure patient trajectories using sequence modeling","abstract":"Transformers have defined the state-of-the-art for clinical prediction tasks involving electronic health records (EHRs). The recently introduced Mamba architecture outperformed an advanced Transformer (Transformer++) based on Llama in handling long context lengths, while using fewer model parameters. Despite the impressive performance of these architectures, a systematic approach to empirically analyze model performance and efficiency under various settings is not well established in the medical domain. The performances of six sequence models were investigated across three architecture classes (Transformers, Transformers++, Mambas) in a large Swedish heart failure (HF) cohort (N = 42820), providing a clinically relevant case study. Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data. This paper presents a first ablation study with systematic design choices for input tokenization, model configuration and temporal data preprocessing. Future model development in clinical prediction tasks using EHRs could build upon this study's recommendation as a starting point."}
{"title":"Utilizing Large Language Models for Zero-Shot Medical Ontology Extension from Clinical Notes","abstract":"Integrating novel medical concepts and relationships into existing ontologies can significantly enhance their coverage and utility for both biomedical research and clinical applications. Clinical notes, as unstructured documents rich with detailed patient observations, offer valuable context-specific insights and represent a promising yet underutilized source for ontology extension. Despite this potential, directly leveraging clinical notes for ontology extension remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose CLOZE, a novel framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically extract medical entities from clinical notes and integrate them into hierarchical medical ontologies. By capitalizing on the strong language understanding and extensive biomedical knowledge of pre-trained LLMs, CLOZE effectively identifies disease-related concepts and captures complex hierarchical relationships. The zero-shot framework requires no additional training or labeled data, making it a cost-efficient solution. Furthermore, CLOZE ensures patient privacy through automated removal of protected health information (PHI). Experimental results demonstrate that CLOZE provides an accurate, scalable, and privacy-preserving ontology extension framework, with strong potential to support a wide range of downstream applications in biomedical research and clinical informatics."}
{"title":"Generative Modeling of Clinical Time Series via Latent Stochastic Differential Equations","abstract":"Clinical time series data from electronic health records and medical registries offer unprecedented opportunities to understand patient trajectories and inform medical decision-making. However, leveraging such data presents significant challenges due to irregular sampling, complex latent physiology, and inherent uncertainties in both measurements and disease progression. To address these challenges, we propose a generative modeling framework based on latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that views clinical time series as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying controlled stochastic dynamical system. Our approach models latent dynamics via neural SDEs with modality-dependent emission models, while performing state estimation and parameter learning through variational inference. This formulation naturally handles irregularly sampled observations, learns complex non-linear interactions, and captures the stochasticity of disease progression and measurement noise within a unified scalable probabilistic framework. We validate the framework on two complementary tasks: (i) individual treatment effect estimation using a simulated pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model of lung cancer, and (ii) probabilistic forecasting of physiological signals using real-world intensive care unit (ICU) data from 12,000 patients. Results show that our framework outperforms ordinary differential equation and long short-term memory baseline models in accuracy and uncertainty estimation. These results highlight its potential for enabling precise, uncertainty-aware predictions to support clinical decision-making."}
{"title":"Beyond Generative AI: World Models for Clinical Prediction, Counterfactuals, and Planning","abstract":"Healthcare requires AI that is predictive, reliable, and data-efficient. However, recent generative models lack physical foundation and temporal reasoning required for clinical decision support. As scaling language models show diminishing returns for grounded clinical reasoning, world models are gaining traction because they learn multimodal, temporally coherent, and action-conditioned representations that reflect the physical and causal structure of care. This paper reviews World Models for healthcare systems that learn predictive dynamics to enable multistep rollouts, counterfactual evaluation and planning. We survey recent work across three domains: (i) medical imaging and diagnostics (e.g., longitudinal tumor simulation, projection-transition modeling, and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture i.e., JEPA-style predictive representation learning), (ii) disease progression modeling from electronic health records (generative event forecasting at scale), and (iii) robotic surgery and surgical planning (action-conditioned guidance and control). We also introduce a capability rubric: L1 temporal prediction, L2 action-conditioned prediction, L3 counterfactual rollouts for decision support, and L4 planning\/control. Most reviewed systems achieve L1--L2, with fewer instances of L3 and rare L4. We identify cross-cutting gaps that limit clinical reliability; under-specified action spaces and safety constraints, weak interventional validation, incomplete multimodal state construction, and limited trajectory-level uncertainty calibration. This review outlines a research agenda for clinically robust prediction-first world models that integrate generative backbones (transformers, diffusion, VAE) with causal\/mechanical foundation for safe decision support in healthcare."}
{"title":"Transparent Early ICU Mortality Prediction with Clinical Transformer and Per-Case Modality Attribution","abstract":"Early identification of intensive care patients at risk of in-hospital mortality enables timely intervention and efficient resource allocation. Despite high predictive performance, existing machine learning approaches lack transparency and robustness, limiting clinical adoption. We present a lightweight, transparent multimodal ensemble that fuses physiological time-series measurements with unstructured clinical notes from the first 48 hours of an ICU stay. A logistic regression model combines predictions from two modality-specific models: a bidirectional LSTM for vitals and a finetuned ClinicalModernBERT transformer for notes. This traceable architecture allows for multilevel interpretability: feature attributions within each modality and direct per-case modality attributions quantifying how vitals and notes influence each decision. On the MIMIC-III benchmark, our late-fusion ensemble improves discrimination over the best single model (AUPRC 0.565 vs. 0.526; AUROC 0.891 vs. 0.876) while maintaining well-calibrated predictions. The system remains robust through a calibrated fallback when a modality is missing. These results demonstrate competitive performance with reliable, auditable risk estimates and transparent, predictable operation, which together are crucial for clinical use."}
{"title":"Balancing Natural Language Processing Accuracy and Normalisation in Extracting Medical Insights","abstract":"Extracting structured medical insights from unstructured clinical text using Natural Language Processing (NLP) remains an open challenge in healthcare, particularly in non-English contexts where resources are scarce. This study presents a comparative analysis of NLP low-compute rule-based methods and Large Language Models (LLMs) for information extraction from electronic health records (EHR) obtained from the Voivodeship Rehabilitation Hospital for Children in Ameryka, Poland. We evaluate both approaches by extracting patient demographics, clinical findings, and prescribed medications while examining the effects of lack of text normalisation and translation-induced information loss. Results demonstrate that rule-based methods provide higher accuracy in information retrieval tasks, particularly for age and sex extraction. However, LLMs offer greater adaptability and scalability, excelling in drug name recognition. The effectiveness of the LLMs was compared with texts originally in Polish and those translated into English, assessing the impact of translation. These findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, normalisation, and computational cost when deploying NLP in healthcare settings. We argue for hybrid approaches that combine the precision of rule-based systems with the adaptability of LLMs, offering a practical path toward more reliable and resource-efficient clinical NLP in real-world hospitals."}
{"title":"OEMA: Ontology-Enhanced Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Zero-Shot Clinical Named Entity Recognition","abstract":"With the rapid expansion of unstructured clinical texts in electronic health records (EHRs), clinical named entity recognition (NER) has become a crucial technique for extracting medical information. However, traditional supervised models such as CRF and BioClinicalBERT suffer from high annotation costs. Although zero-shot NER based on large language models (LLMs) reduces the dependency on labeled data, challenges remain in aligning example selection with task granularity and effectively integrating prompt design with self-improvement frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose OEMA, a novel zero-shot clinical NER framework based on multi-agent collaboration. OEMA consists of three core components: (1) a self-annotator that autonomously generates candidate examples; (2) a discriminator that leverages SNOMED CT to filter token-level examples by clinical relevance; and (3) a predictor that incorporates entity-type descriptions to enhance inference accuracy. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets, MTSamples and VAERS, demonstrate that OEMA achieves state-of-the-art performance under exact-match evaluation. Moreover, under related-match criteria, OEMA performs comparably to the supervised BioClinicalBERT model while significantly outperforming the traditional CRF method. OEMA improves zero-shot clinical NER, achieving near-supervised performance under related-match criteria. Future work will focus on continual learning and open-domain adaptation to expand its applicability in clinical NLP."}
{"title":"Oversampling techniques for predicting COVID-19 patient length of stay","abstract":"COVID-19 is a respiratory disease that caused a global pandemic in 2019. It is highly infectious and has the following symptoms: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, the new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms vary in severity; some people with many risk factors have been known to have lengthy hospital stays or die from the disease. In this paper, we analyze patients' electronic health records (EHR) to predict the severity of their COVID-19 infection using the length of stay (LOS) as our measurement of severity. This is an imbalanced classification problem, as many people have a shorter LOS rather than a longer one. To combat this problem, we synthetically create alternate oversampled training data sets. Once we have this oversampled data, we run it through an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which during training has its hyperparameters tuned using Bayesian optimization. We select the model with the best F1 score and then evaluate it and discuss it."}
{"title":"A Specialized Large Language Model for Clinical Reasoning and Diagnosis in Rare Diseases","abstract":"Rare diseases affect hundreds of millions worldwide, yet diagnosis often spans years. Convectional pipelines decouple noisy evidence extraction from downstream inferential diagnosis, and general\/medical large language models (LLMs) face scarce real world electronic health records (EHRs), stale domain knowledge, and hallucinations. We assemble a large, domain specialized clinical corpus and a clinician validated reasoning set, and develop RareSeek R1 via staged instruction tuning, chain of thought learning, and graph grounded retrieval. Across multicenter EHR narratives and public benchmarks, RareSeek R1 attains state of the art accuracy, robust generalization, and stability under noisy or overlapping phenotypes. Augmented retrieval yields the largest gains when narratives pair with prioritized variants by resolving ambiguity and aligning candidates to mechanisms. Human studies show performance on par with experienced physicians and consistent gains in assistive use. Notably, transparent reasoning highlights decisive non phenotypic evidence (median 23.1%, such as imaging, interventions, functional tests) underpinning many correct diagnoses. This work advances a narrative first, knowledge integrated reasoning paradigm that shortens the diagnostic odyssey and enables auditable, clinically translatable decision support."}
{"title":"A Method for Characterizing Disease Progression from Acute Kidney Injury to Chronic Kidney Disease","abstract":"Patients with acute kidney injury (AKI) are at high risk of developing chronic kidney disease (CKD), but identifying those at greatest risk remains challenging. We used electronic health record (EHR) data to dynamically track AKI patients' clinical evolution and characterize AKI-to-CKD progression. Post-AKI clinical states were identified by clustering patient vectors derived from longitudinal medical codes and creatinine measurements. Transition probabilities between states and progression to CKD were estimated using multi-state modeling. After identifying common post-AKI trajectories, CKD risk factors in AKI subpopulations were identified through survival analysis. Of 20,699 patients with AKI at admission, 3,491 (17%) developed CKD. We identified fifteen distinct post-AKI states, each with different probabilities of CKD development. Most patients (75%, n=15,607) remained in a single state or made only one transition during the study period. Both established (e.g., AKI severity, diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, liver disease) and novel CKD risk factors, with their impact varying across these clinical states. This study demonstrates a data-driven approach for identifying high-risk AKI patients, supporting the development of decision-support tools for early CKD detection and intervention."}
{"title":"Synthetic Clinical Notes for Rare ICD Codes: A Data-Centric Framework for Long-Tail Medical Coding","abstract":"Automatic ICD coding from clinical text is a critical task in medical NLP but remains hindered by the extreme long-tail distribution of diagnostic codes. Thousands of rare and zero-shot ICD codes are severely underrepresented in datasets like MIMIC-III, leading to low macro-F1 scores. In this work, we propose a data-centric framework that generates high-quality synthetic discharge summaries to mitigate this imbalance. Our method constructs realistic multi-label code sets anchored on rare codes by leveraging real-world co-occurrence patterns, ICD descriptions, synonyms, taxonomy, and similar clinical notes. Using these structured prompts, we generate 90,000 synthetic notes covering 7,902 ICD codes, significantly expanding the training distribution. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art transformer-based models, PLM-ICD and GKI-ICD, on both the original and extended datasets. Experiments show that our approach modestly improves macro-F1 while maintaining strong micro-F1, outperforming prior SOTA. While the gain may seem marginal relative to the computational cost, our results demonstrate that carefully crafted synthetic data can enhance equity in long-tail ICD code prediction."}
{"title":"Towards Multimodal Representation Learning in Paediatric Kidney Disease","abstract":"Paediatric kidney disease varies widely in its presentation and progression, which calls for continuous monitoring of renal function. Using electronic health records collected between 2019 and 2025 at Great Ormond Street Hospital, a leading UK paediatric hospital, we explored a temporal modelling approach that integrates longitudinal laboratory sequences with demographic information. A recurrent neural model trained on these data was used to predict whether a child would record an abnormal serum creatinine value within the following thirty days. Framed as a pilot study, this work provides an initial demonstration that simple temporal representations can capture useful patterns in routine paediatric data and lays the groundwork for future multimodal extensions using additional clinical signals and more detailed renal outcomes."}
{"title":"MedDCR: Learning to Design Agentic Workflows for Medical Coding","abstract":"Medical coding converts free-text clinical notes into standardized diagnostic and procedural codes, which are essential for billing, hospital operations, and medical research. Unlike ordinary text classification, it requires multi-step reasoning: extracting diagnostic concepts, applying guideline constraints, mapping to hierarchical codebooks, and ensuring cross-document consistency. Recent advances leverage agentic LLMs, but most rely on rigid, manually crafted workflows that fail to capture the nuance and variability of real-world documentation, leaving open the question of how to systematically learn effective workflows. We present MedDCR, a closed-loop framework that treats workflow design as a learning problem. A Designer proposes workflows, a Coder executes them, and a Reflector evaluates predictions and provides constructive feedback, while a memory archive preserves prior designs for reuse and iterative refinement. On benchmark datasets, MedDCR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and produces interpretable, adaptable workflows that better reflect real coding practice, improving both the reliability and trustworthiness of automated systems."}
{"title":"SurvBench: A Standardised Preprocessing Pipeline for Multi-Modal Electronic Health Record Survival Analysis","abstract":"Electronic health record (EHR) data present tremendous opportunities for advancing survival analysis through deep learning, yet reproducibility remains severely constrained by inconsistent preprocessing methodologies. We present SurvBench, a comprehensive, open-source preprocessing pipeline that transforms raw PhysioNet datasets into standardised, model-ready tensors for multi-modal survival analysis. SurvBench provides data loaders for three major critical care databases, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and MC-MED, supporting diverse modalities including time-series vitals, static demographics, ICD diagnosis codes, and radiology reports. The pipeline implements rigorous data quality controls, patient-level splitting to prevent data leakage, explicit missingness tracking, and standardised temporal aggregation. SurvBench handles both single-risk (e.g., in-hospital mortality) and competing-risks scenarios (e.g., multiple discharge outcomes). The outputs are compatible with pycox library packages and implementations of standard statistical and deep learning models. By providing reproducible, configuration-driven preprocessing with comprehensive documentation, SurvBench addresses the \"preprocessing gap\" that has hindered fair comparison of deep learning survival models, enabling researchers to focus on methodological innovation rather than data engineering."}
{"title":"ClinStructor: AI-Powered Structuring of Unstructured Clinical Texts","abstract":"Clinical notes contain valuable, context-rich information, but their unstructured format introduces several challenges, including unintended biases (e.g., gender or racial bias), and poor generalization across clinical settings (e.g., models trained on one EHR system may perform poorly on another due to format differences) and poor interpretability. To address these issues, we present ClinStructor, a pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to convert clinical free-text into structured, task-specific question-answer pairs prior to predictive modeling. Our method substantially enhances transparency and controllability and only leads to a modest reduction in predictive performance (a 2-3% drop in AUC), compared to direct fine-tuning, on the ICU mortality prediction task. ClinStructor lays a strong foundation for building reliable, interpretable, and generalizable machine learning models in clinical environments."}
{"title":"CURENet: Combining Unified Representations for Efficient Chronic Disease Prediction","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes."}
{"title":"Toward Scalable Early Cancer Detection: Evaluating EHR-Based Predictive Models Against Traditional Screening Criteria","abstract":"Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies."}
{"title":"SCARE: A Benchmark for SQL Correction and Question Answerability Classification for Reliable EHR Question Answering","abstract":"Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled the development of text-to-SQL models that allow clinicians to query structured data stored in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using natural language. However, deploying these models for EHR question answering (QA) systems in safety-critical clinical environments remains challenging: incorrect SQL queries-whether caused by model errors or problematic user inputs-can undermine clinical decision-making and jeopardize patient care. While prior work has mainly focused on improving SQL generation accuracy or filtering questions before execution, there is a lack of a unified benchmark for evaluating independent post-hoc verification mechanisms (i.e., a component that inspects and validates the generated SQL before execution), which is crucial for safe deployment. To fill this gap, we introduce SCARE, a benchmark for evaluating methods that function as a post-hoc safety layer in EHR QA systems. SCARE evaluates the joint task of (1) classifying question answerability (i.e., determining whether a question is answerable, ambiguous, or unanswerable) and (2) verifying or correcting candidate SQL queries. The benchmark comprises 4,200 triples of questions, candidate SQL queries, and expected model outputs, grounded in the MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, and eICU databases. It covers a diverse set of questions and corresponding candidate SQL queries generated by seven different text-to-SQL models, ensuring a realistic and challenging evaluation. Using SCARE, we benchmark a range of approaches-from two-stage methods to agentic frameworks. Our experiments reveal a critical trade-off between question classification and SQL error correction, highlighting key challenges and outlining directions for future research."}
{"title":"TempoQL: A Readable, Precise, and Portable Query System for Electronic Health Record Data","abstract":"Electronic health record (EHR) data is an essential data source for machine learning for health, but researchers and clinicians face steep barriers in extracting and validating EHR data for modeling. Existing tools incur trade-offs between expressivity and usability and are typically specialized to a single data standard, making it difficult to write temporal queries that are ready for modern model-building pipelines and adaptable to new datasets. This paper introduces TempoQL, a Python-based toolkit designed to lower these barriers. TempoQL provides a simple, human-readable language for temporal queries; support for multiple EHR data standards, including OMOP, MEDS, and others; and an interactive notebook-based query interface with optional large language model (LLM) authoring assistance. Through a performance evaluation and two use cases on different datasets, we demonstrate that TempoQL simplifies the creation of cohorts for machine learning while maintaining precision, speed, and reproducibility."}
{"title":"MedFuse: Multiplicative Embedding Fusion For Irregular Clinical Time Series","abstract":"Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series."}
{"title":"Multi-level Latent Variable Models for Coheritability Analysis in Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) linked with familial relationship data offer a unique opportunity to investigate the genetic architecture of complex phenotypes at scale. However, existing heritability and coheritability estimation methods often fail to account for the intricacies of familial correlation structures, heterogeneity across phenotype types, and computational scalability. We propose a robust and flexible statistical framework for jointly estimating heritability and genetic correlation among continuous and binary phenotypes in EHR-based family studies. Our approach builds on multi-level latent variable models to decompose phenotypic covariance into interpretable genetic and environmental components, incorporating both within- and between-family variations. We derive iteration algorithms based on generalized equation estimations (GEE) for estimation. Simulation studies under various parameter configurations demonstrate that our estimators are consistent and yield valid inference across a range of realistic settings. Applying our methods to real-world EHR data from a large, urban health system, we identify significant genetic correlations between mental health conditions and endocrine\/metabolic phenotypes, supporting hypotheses of shared etiology. This work provides a scalable and rigorous framework for coheritability analysis in high-dimensional EHR data and facilitates the identification of shared genetic influences in complex disease networks."}
{"title":"EHRStruct: A Comprehensive Benchmark Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models on Structured Electronic Health Record Tasks","abstract":"Structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data stores patient information in relational tables and plays a central role in clinical decision-making. Recent advances have explored the use of large language models (LLMs) to process such data, showing promise across various clinical tasks. However, the absence of standardized evaluation frameworks and clearly defined tasks makes it difficult to systematically assess and compare LLM performance on structured EHR data. To address these evaluation challenges, we introduce EHRStruct, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLMs on structured EHR tasks. EHRStruct defines 11 representative tasks spanning diverse clinical needs and includes 2,200 task-specific evaluation samples derived from two widely used EHR datasets. We use EHRStruct to evaluate 20 advanced and representative LLMs, covering both general and medical models. We further analyze key factors influencing model performance, including input formats, few-shot generalisation, and finetuning strategies, and compare results with 11 state-of-the-art LLM-based enhancement methods for structured data reasoning. Our results indicate that many structured EHR tasks place high demands on the understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. In response, we propose EHRMaster, a code-augmented method that achieves state-of-the-art performance and offers practical insights to guide future research."}
{"title":"ACE-ICD: Acronym Expansion As Data Augmentation For Automated ICD Coding","abstract":"Automatic ICD coding, the task of assigning disease and procedure codes to electronic medical records, is crucial for clinical documentation and billing. While existing methods primarily enhance model understanding of code hierarchies and synonyms, they often overlook the pervasive use of medical acronyms in clinical notes, a key factor in ICD code inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel effective data augmentation technique that leverages large language models to expand medical acronyms, allowing models to be trained on their full form representations. Moreover, we incorporate consistency training to regularize predictions by enforcing agreement between the original and augmented documents. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our approach, ACE-ICD establishes new state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings, including common codes, rare codes, and full-code assignments. Our code is publicly available."}
{"title":"Dual-Pathway Fusion of EHRs and Knowledge Graphs for Predicting Unseen Drug-Drug Interactions","abstract":"Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) remain a major source of preventable harm, and many clinically important mechanisms are still unknown. Existing models either rely on pharmacologic knowledge graphs (KGs), which fail on unseen drugs, or on electronic health records (EHRs), which are noisy, temporal, and site-dependent. We introduce, to our knowledge, the first system that conditions KG relation scoring on patient-level EHR context and distills that reasoning into an EHR-only model for zero-shot inference. A fusion \"Teacher\" learns mechanism-specific relations for drug pairs represented in both sources, while a distilled \"Student\" generalizes to new or rarely used drugs without KG access at inference. Both operate under a shared ontology (set) of pharmacologic mechanisms (drug relations) to produce interpretable, auditable alerts rather than opaque risk scores. Trained on a multi-institution EHR corpus paired with a curated DrugBank DDI graph, and evaluated using a clinically aligned, decision-focused protocol with leakage-safe negatives that avoid artificially easy pairs, the system maintains precision across multi-institutuion test data, produces mechanism-specific, clinically consistent predictions, reduces false alerts (higher precision) at comparable overall detection performance (F1), and misses fewer true interactions compared to prior methods. Case studies further show zero-shot identification of clinically recognized CYP-mediated and pharmacodynamic mechanisms for drugs absent from the KG, supporting real-world use in clinical decision support and pharmacovigilance."}
{"title":"Overview of CHIP 2025 Shared Task 2: Discharge Medication Recommendation for Metabolic Diseases Based on Chinese Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Discharge medication recommendation plays a critical role in ensuring treatment continuity, preventing readmission, and improving long-term management for patients with chronic metabolic diseases. This paper present an overview of the CHIP 2025 Shared Task 2 competition, which aimed to develop state-of-the-art approaches for automatically recommending appro-priate discharge medications using real-world Chinese EHR data. For this task, we constructed CDrugRed, a high-quality dataset consisting of 5,894 de-identified hospitalization records from 3,190 patients in China. This task is challenging due to multi-label nature of medication recommendation, het-erogeneous clinical text, and patient-specific variability in treatment plans. A total of 526 teams registered, with 167 and 95 teams submitting valid results to the Phase A and Phase B leaderboards, respectively. The top-performing team achieved the highest overall performance on the final test set, with a Jaccard score of 0.5102, F1 score of 0.6267, demonstrating the potential of advanced large language model (LLM)-based ensemble systems. These re-sults highlight both the promise and remaining challenges of applying LLMs to medication recommendation in Chinese EHRs. The post-evaluation phase remains open at https:\/\/tianchi.aliyun.com\/competition\/entrance\/532411\/."}
{"title":"RELEAP: Reinforcement-Enhanced Label-Efficient Active Phenotyping for Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Objective: Electronic health record (EHR) phenotyping often relies on noisy proxy labels, which undermine the reliability of downstream risk prediction. Active learning can reduce annotation costs, but most rely on fixed heuristics and do not ensure that phenotype refinement improves prediction performance. Our goal was to develop a framework that directly uses downstream prediction performance as feedback to guide phenotype correction and sample selection under constrained labeling budgets.\n  Materials and Methods: We propose Reinforcement-Enhanced Label-Efficient Active Phenotyping (RELEAP), a reinforcement learning-based active learning framework. RELEAP adaptively integrates multiple querying strategies and, unlike prior methods, updates its policy based on feedback from downstream models. We evaluated RELEAP on a de-identified Duke University Health System (DUHS) cohort (2014-2024) for incident lung cancer risk prediction, using logistic regression and penalized Cox survival models. Performance was benchmarked against noisy-label baselines and single-strategy active learning.\n  Results: RELEAP consistently outperformed all baselines. Logistic AUC increased from 0.774 to 0.805 and survival C-index from 0.718 to 0.752. Using downstream performance as feedback, RELEAP produced smoother and more stable gains than heuristic methods under the same labeling budget.\n  Discussion: By linking phenotype refinement to prediction outcomes, RELEAP learns which samples most improve downstream discrimination and calibration, offering a more principled alternative to fixed active learning rules.\n  Conclusion: RELEAP optimizes phenotype correction through downstream feedback, offering a scalable, label-efficient paradigm that reduces manual chart review and enhances the reliability of EHR-based risk prediction."}
{"title":"Deep Survival Analysis of Longitudinal EHR Data for Joint Prediction of Hospitalization and Death in COPD Patients","abstract":"Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have an increased risk of hospitalizations, strongly associated with decreased survival, yet predicting the timing of these events remains challenging and has received limited attention in the literature. In this study, we performed survival analysis to predict hospitalization and death in COPD patients using longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs), comparing statistical models, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) approaches. We analyzed data from more than 150k patients from the SIDIAP database in Catalonia, Spain, from 2013 to 2017, modeling hospitalization as a first event and death as a semi-competing terminal event. Multiple models were evaluated, including Cox proportional hazards, SurvivalBoost, DeepPseudo, SurvTRACE, Dynamic Deep-Hit, and Deep Recurrent Survival Machine. Results showed that DL models utilizing recurrent architectures outperformed both ML and linear approaches in concordance and time-dependent AUC, especially for hospitalization, which proved to be the harder event to predict. This study is, to our knowledge, the first to apply deep survival analysis on longitudinal EHR data to jointly predict multiple time-to-event outcomes in COPD patients, highlighting the potential of DL approaches to capture temporal patterns and improve risk stratification."}
{"title":"Near-Exponential Savings for Mean Estimation with Active Learning","abstract":"We study the problem of efficiently estimating the mean of a $k$-class random variable, $Y$, using a limited number of labels, $N$, in settings where the analyst has access to auxiliary information (i.e.: covariates) $X$ that may be informative about $Y$. We propose an active learning algorithm (\"PartiBandits\") to estimate $\\mathbb{E}[Y]$. The algorithm yields an estimate, $\\widehat\u03bc_{\\text{PB}}$, such that $\\left( \\widehat\u03bc_{\\text{PB}} - \\mathbb{E}[Y]\\right)^2$ is $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left( \\frac{\u03bd+ \\exp(c \\cdot (-N\/\\log(N))) }{N} \\right)$, where $c > 0$ is a constant and $\u03bd$ is the risk of the Bayes-optimal classifier. PartiBandits is essentially a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, it learns a partition of the unlabeled data that shrinks the average conditional variance of $Y$. In the second stage it uses a UCB-style subroutine (\"WarmStart-UCB\") to request labels from each stratum round-by-round. Both the main algorithm's and the subroutine's convergence rates are minimax optimal in classical settings. PartiBandits bridges the UCB and disagreement-based approaches to active learning despite these two approaches being designed to tackle very different tasks. We illustrate our methods through simulation using nationwide electronic health records. Our methods can be implemented using the PartiBandits package in R."}
{"title":"MIMIC-SR-ICD11: A Dataset for Narrative-Based Diagnosis","abstract":"Disease diagnosis is a central pillar of modern healthcare, enabling early detection and timely intervention for acute conditions while guiding lifestyle adjustments and medication regimens to prevent or slow chronic disease. Self-reports preserve clinically salient signals that templated electronic health record (EHR) documentation often attenuates or omits, especially subtle but consequential details. To operationalize this shift, we introduce MIMIC-SR-ICD11, a large English diagnostic dataset built from EHR discharge notes and natively aligned to WHO ICD-11 terminology. We further present LL-Rank, a likelihood-based re-ranking framework that computes a length-normalized joint likelihood of each label given the clinical report context and subtracts the corresponding report-free prior likelihood for that label. Across seven model backbones, LL-Rank consistently outperforms a strong generation-plus-mapping baseline (GenMap). Ablation experiments show that LL-Rank's gains primarily stem from its PMI-based scoring, which isolates semantic compatibility from label frequency bias."}
{"title":"Embedding-Space Data Augmentation to Prevent Membership Inference Attacks in Clinical Time Series Forecasting","abstract":"Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR\/FPR ratio for MIA attacks without sacrificing performance on test data."}
{"title":"BiPETE: A Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder for Risk Assessment of Alcohol and Substance Use Disorder with Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Transformer-based deep learning models have shown promise for disease risk prediction using electronic health records(EHRs), but modeling temporal dependencies remains a key challenge due to irregular visit intervals and lack of uniform structure. We propose a Bi-Positional Embedding Transformer Encoder or BiPETE for single-disease prediction, which integrates rotary positional embeddings to encode relative visit timing and sinusoidal embeddings to preserve visit order. Without relying on large-scale pretraining, BiPETE is trained on EHR data from two mental health cohorts-depressive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-to predict the risk of alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD). BiPETE outperforms baseline models, improving the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) by 34% and 50% in the depression and PTSD cohorts, respectively. An ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the dual positional encoding strategy. We apply the Integrated Gradients method to interpret model predictions, identifying key clinical features associated with ASUD risk and protection, such as abnormal inflammatory, hematologic, and metabolic markers, as well as specific medications and comorbidities. Overall, these key clinical features identified by the attribution methods contribute to a deeper understanding of the risk assessment process and offer valuable clues for mitigating potential risks. In summary, our study presents a practical and interpretable framework for disease risk prediction using EHR data, which can achieve strong performance."}
{"title":"Early GVHD Prediction in Liver Transplantation via Multi-Modal Deep Learning on Imbalanced EHR Data","abstract":"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a rare but often fatal complication in liver transplantation, with a very high mortality rate. By harnessing multi-modal deep learning methods to integrate heterogeneous and imbalanced electronic health records (EHR), we aim to advance early prediction of GVHD, paving the way for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. In this study, we analyzed pre-transplant electronic health records (EHR) spanning the period before surgery for 2,100 liver transplantation patients, including 42 cases of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), from a cohort treated at Mayo Clinic between 1992 and 2025. The dataset comprised four major modalities: patient demographics, laboratory tests, diagnoses, and medications. We developed a multi-modal deep learning framework that dynamically fuses these modalities, handles irregular records with missing values, and addresses extreme class imbalance through AUC-based optimization. The developed framework outperforms all single-modal and multi-modal machine learning baselines, achieving an AUC of 0.836, an AUPRC of 0.157, a recall of 0.768, and a specificity of 0.803. It also demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in capturing complementary information from different modalities, leading to improved performance. Our multi-modal deep learning framework substantially improves existing approaches for early GVHD prediction. By effectively addressing the challenges of heterogeneity and extreme class imbalance in real-world EHR, it achieves accurate early prediction. Our proposed multi-modal deep learning method demonstrates promising results for early prediction of a GVHD in liver transplantation, despite the challenge of extremely imbalanced EHR data."}
{"title":"Deep Learning Approach for Clinical Risk Identification Using Transformer Modeling of Heterogeneous EHR Data","abstract":"This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns, large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-Score, achieving stable and precise risk identification in multi-source heterogeneous EHR environments and providing an efficient and reliable framework for clinical intelligent decision-making."}
{"title":"FusionDP: Foundation Model-Assisted Differentially Private Learning for Partially Sensitive Features","abstract":"Ensuring the privacy of sensitive training data is crucial in privacy-preserving machine learning. However, in practical scenarios, privacy protection may be required for only a subset of features. For instance, in ICU data, demographic attributes like age and gender pose higher privacy risks due to their re-identification potential, whereas raw lab results are generally less sensitive. Traditional DP-SGD enforces privacy protection on all features in one sample, leading to excessive noise injection and significant utility degradation. We propose FusionDP, a two-step framework that enhances model utility under feature-level differential privacy. First, FusionDP leverages large foundation models to impute sensitive features given non-sensitive features, treating them as external priors that provide high-quality estimates of sensitive attributes without accessing the true values during model training. Second, we introduce a modified DP-SGD algorithm that trains models on both original and imputed features while formally preserving the privacy of the original sensitive features. We evaluate FusionDP on two modalities: a sepsis prediction task on tabular data from PhysioNet and a clinical note classification task from MIMIC-III. By comparing against privacy-preserving baselines, our results show that FusionDP significantly improves model performance while maintaining rigorous feature-level privacy, demonstrating the potential of foundation model-driven imputation to enhance the privacy-utility trade-off for various modalities."}
{"title":"Cross-Modal Alignment via Variational Copula Modelling","abstract":"Various data modalities are common in real-world applications (e.g., electronic health records, medical images and clinical notes in healthcare). It is essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various information from multiple modalities. The main challenge is how to appropriately align and fuse the representations of different modalities into a joint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the Kronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities and indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the joint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is underexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the interactions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution and marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel copula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the joint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions among them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align the marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a Gaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint distribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing modalities. Extensive experiments on public MIMIC datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors. The code is available at https:\/\/github.com\/HKU-MedAI\/CMCM."}
{"title":"DANIEL: A Distributed and Scalable Approach for Global Representation Learning with EHR Applications","abstract":"Classical probabilistic graphical models face fundamental challenges in modern data environments, which are characterized by high dimensionality, source heterogeneity, and stringent data-sharing constraints. In this work, we revisit the Ising model, a well-established member of the Markov Random Field (MRF) family, and develop a distributed framework that enables scalable and privacy-preserving representation learning from large-scale binary data with inherent low-rank structure. Our approach optimizes a non-convex surrogate loss function via bi-factored gradient descent, offering substantial computational and communication advantages over conventional convex approaches. We evaluate our algorithm on multi-institutional electronic health record (EHR) datasets from 58,248 patients across the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) and Mass General Brigham (MGB), demonstrating superior performance in global representation learning and downstream clinical tasks, including relationship detection, patient phenotyping, and patient clustering. These results highlight a broader potential for statistical inference in federated, high-dimensional settings while addressing the practical challenges of data complexity and multi-institutional integration."}
{"title":"Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Prediction Using Transformer","abstract":"Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects nearly 10\\% of the global population and often progresses to end-stage renal failure. Accurate prognosis prediction is vital for timely interventions and resource optimization. We present a transformer-based framework for predicting CKD progression using multi-modal electronic health records (EHR) from the Seoul National University Hospital OMOP Common Data Model. Our approach (\\textbf{ProQ-BERT}) integrates demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, employing quantization-based tokenization for continuous lab values and attention mechanisms for interpretability. The model was pretrained with masked language modeling and fine-tuned for binary classification tasks predicting progression from stage 3a to stage 5 across varying follow-up and assessment periods. Evaluated on a cohort of 91,816 patients, our model consistently outperformed CEHR-BERT, achieving ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989 for short-term prediction. These results highlight the effectiveness of transformer architectures and temporal design choices in clinical prognosis modeling, offering a promising direction for personalized CKD care."}
{"title":"Enhancing Phenotype Discovery in Electronic Health Records through Prior Knowledge-Guided Unsupervised Learning","abstract":"Objectives: Unsupervised learning with electronic health record (EHR) data has shown promise for phenotype discovery, but approaches typically disregard existing clinical information, limiting interpretability. We operationalize a Bayesian latent class framework for phenotyping that incorporates domain-specific knowledge to improve clinical meaningfulness of EHR-derived phenotypes and illustrate its utility by identifying an asthma sub-phenotype informed by features of Type 2 (T2) inflammation.\n  Materials and methods: We illustrate a framework for incorporating clinical knowledge into a Bayesian latent class model via informative priors to guide unsupervised clustering toward clinically relevant subgroups. This approach models missingness, accounting for potential missing-not-at-random patterns, and provides patient-level probabilities for phenotype assignment with uncertainty. Using reusable and flexible code, we applied the model to a large asthma EHR cohort, specifying informative priors for T2 inflammation-related features and weakly informative priors for other clinical variables, allowing the data to inform posterior distributions.\n  Results and Conclusion: Using encounter data from January 2017 to February 2024 for 44,642 adult asthma patients, we found a bimodal posterior distribution of phenotype assignment, indicating clear class separation. The T2 inflammation-informed class (38.7%) was characterized by elevated eosinophil levels and allergy markers, plus high healthcare utilization and medication use, despite weakly informative priors on the latter variables. These patterns suggest an \"uncontrolled T2-high\" sub-phenotype. This demonstrates how our Bayesian latent class modeling approach supports hypothesis generation and cohort identification in EHR-based studies of heterogeneous diseases without well-established phenotype definitions."}
{"title":"From Passive to Proactive: A Multi-Agent System with Dynamic Task Orchestration for Intelligent Medical Pre-Consultation","abstract":"Global healthcare systems face critical challenges from increasing patient volumes and limited consultation times, with primary care visits averaging under 5 minutes in many countries. While pre-consultation processes encompassing triage and structured history-taking offer potential solutions, they remain limited by passive interaction paradigms and context management challenges in existing AI systems. This study introduces a hierarchical multi-agent framework that transforms passive medical AI systems into proactive inquiry agents through autonomous task orchestration. We developed an eight-agent architecture with centralized control mechanisms that decomposes pre-consultation into four primary tasks: Triage ($T_1$), History of Present Illness collection ($T_2$), Past History collection ($T_3$), and Chief Complaint generation ($T_4$), with $T_1$--$T_3$ further divided into 13 domain-specific subtasks. Evaluated on 1,372 validated electronic health records from a Chinese medical platform across multiple foundation models (GPT-OSS 20B, Qwen3-8B, Phi4-14B), the framework achieved 87.0% accuracy for primary department triage and 80.5% for secondary department classification, with task completion rates reaching 98.2% using agent-driven scheduling versus 93.1% with sequential processing. Clinical quality scores from 18 physicians averaged 4.56 for Chief Complaints, 4.48 for History of Present Illness, and 4.69 for Past History on a 5-point scale, with consultations completed within 12.7 rounds for $T_2$ and 16.9 rounds for $T_3$. The model-agnostic architecture maintained high performance across different foundation models while preserving data privacy through local deployment, demonstrating the potential for autonomous AI systems to enhance pre-consultation efficiency and quality in clinical settings."}
{"title":"KAT-GNN: A Knowledge-Augmented Temporal Graph Neural Network for Risk Prediction in Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Clinical risk prediction using electronic health records (EHRs) is vital to facilitate timely interventions and clinical decision support. However, modeling heterogeneous and irregular temporal EHR data presents significant challenges. We propose \\textbf{KAT-GNN} (Knowledge-Augmented Temporal Graph Neural Network), a graph-based framework that integrates clinical knowledge and temporal dynamics for risk prediction. KAT-GNN first constructs modality-specific patient graphs from EHRs. These graphs are then augmented using two knowledge sources: (1) ontology-driven edges derived from SNOMED CT and (2) co-occurrence priors extracted from EHRs. Subsequently, a time-aware transformer is employed to capture longitudinal dynamics from the graph-encoded patient representations. KAT-GNN is evaluated on three distinct datasets and tasks: coronary artery disease (CAD) prediction using the Chang Gung Research Database (CGRD) and in-hospital mortality prediction using the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets. KAT-GNN achieves state-of-the-art performance in CAD prediction (AUROC: 0.9269 $\\pm$ 0.0029) and demonstrated strong results in mortality prediction in MIMIC-III (AUROC: 0.9230 $\\pm$ 0.0070) and MIMIC-IV (AUROC: 0.8849 $\\pm$ 0.0089), consistently outperforming established baselines such as GRASP and RETAIN. Ablation studies confirm that both knowledge-based augmentation and the temporal modeling component are significant contributors to performance gains. These findings demonstrate that the integration of clinical knowledge into graph representations, coupled with a time-aware attention mechanism, provides an effective and generalizable approach for risk prediction across diverse clinical tasks and datasets."}
{"title":"Count-Based Approaches Remain Strong: A Benchmark Against Transformer and LLM Pipelines on Structured EHR","abstract":"Structured electronic health records (EHR) are essential for clinical prediction. While count-based learners continue to perform strongly on such data, no benchmarking has directly compared them against more recent mixture-of-agents LLM pipelines, which have been reported to outperform single LLMs in various NLP tasks. In this study, we evaluated three categories of methodologies for EHR prediction using the EHRSHOT dataset: count-based models built from ontology roll-ups with two time bins, based on LightGBM and the tabular foundation model TabPFN; a pretrained sequential transformer (CLMBR); and a mixture-of-agents pipeline that converts tabular histories to natural-language summaries followed by a text classifier. We assessed eight outcomes using the EHRSHOT dataset. Across the eight evaluation tasks, head-to-head wins were largely split between the count-based and the mixture-of-agents methods. Given their simplicity and interpretability, count-based models remain a strong candidate for structured EHR benchmarking.

{"title":"Reliable Curation of EHR Dataset via Large Language Models under Environmental Constraints","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) are central to modern healthcare delivery and research; yet, many researchers lack the database expertise necessary to write complex SQL queries or generate effective visualizations, limiting efficient data use and scientific discovery. To address this barrier, we introduce CELEC, a large language model (LLM)-powered framework for automated EHR data extraction and analytics. CELEC translates natural language queries into SQL using a prompting strategy that integrates schema information, few-shot demonstrations, and chain-of-thought reasoning, which together improve accuracy and robustness. On a subset of the EHRSQL benchmark, CELEC achieves execution accuracy comparable to prior systems while maintaining low latency, cost efficiency, and strict privacy by exposing only database metadata to the LLM. CELEC also adheres to strict privacy protocols: the LLM accesses only database metadata (e.g., table and column names), while all query execution occurs securely within the institutional environment, ensuring that no patient-level data is ever transmitted to or shared with the LLM. Ablation studies confirm that each component of the SQL generation pipeline, particularly the few-shot demonstrations, plays a critical role in performance. By lowering technical barriers and enabling medical researchers to query EHR databases directly, CELEC streamlines research workflows and accelerates biomedical discovery."}
{"title":"Supporting Patients in Managing Electronic Health Records and Biospecimens Consent for Research: Insights from a Mixed-Methods Usability Evaluation of the iAGREE Portal","abstract":"De-identified health data are frequently used in research. As AI advances heighten the risk of re-identification, it is important to respond to concerns about transparency, data privacy, and patient preferences. However, few practical and user-friendly solutions exist. We developed iAGREE, a patient-centered electronic consent management portal that allows patients to set granular preferences for sharing electronic health records and biospecimens with researchers. To refine the iAGREE portal, we conducted a mixed-methods usability evaluation with 40 participants from three U.S. health systems. Our results show that the portal received highly positive usability feedback. Moreover, participants identified areas for improvement, suggested actionable enhancements, and proposed additional features to better support informed granular consent while reducing patient burden. Insights from this study may inform further improvements to iAGREE and provide practical guidance for designing patient-centered consent management tools."}
{"title":"Multilingual BERT language model for medical tasks: Evaluation on domain-specific adaptation and cross-linguality","abstract":"In multilingual healthcare applications, the availability of domain-specific natural language processing(NLP) tools is limited, especially for low-resource languages. Although multilingual bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) offers a promising motivation to mitigate the language gap, the medical NLP tasks in low-resource languages are still underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates how further pre-training on domain-specific corpora affects model performance on medical tasks, focusing on three languages: Dutch, Romanian and Spanish. In terms of further pre-training, we conducted four experiments to create medical domain models. Then, these models were fine-tuned on three downstream tasks: Automated patient screening in Dutch clinical notes, named entity recognition in Romanian and Spanish clinical notes. Results show that domain adaptation significantly enhanced task performance. Furthermore, further differentiation of domains, e.g. clinical and general biomedical domains, resulted in diverse performances. The clinical domain-adapted model outperformed the more general biomedical domain-adapted model. Moreover, we observed evidence of cross-lingual transferability. Moreover, we also conducted further investigations to explore potential reasons contributing to these performance differences. These findings highlight the feasibility of domain adaptation and cross-lingual ability in medical NLP. Within the low-resource language settings, these findings can provide meaningful guidance for developing multilingual medical NLP systems to mitigate the lack of training data and thereby improve the model performance."}
{"title":"MedM2T: A MultiModal Framework for Time-Aware Modeling with Electronic Health Record and Electrocardiogram Data","abstract":"The inherent multimodality and heterogeneous temporal structures of medical data pose significant challenges for modeling. We propose MedM2T, a time-aware multimodal framework designed to address these complexities. MedM2T integrates: (i) Sparse Time Series Encoder to flexibly handle irregular and sparse time series, (ii) Hierarchical Time-Aware Fusion to capture both micro- and macro-temporal patterns from multiple dense time series, such as ECGs, and (iii) Bi-Modal Attention to extract cross-modal interactions, which can be extended to any number of modalities. To mitigate granularity gaps between modalities, MedM2T uses modality-specific pre-trained encoders and aligns resulting features within a shared encoder. We evaluated MedM2T on MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-IV-ECG datasets for three tasks that encompass chronic and acute disease dynamics: 90-day cardiovascular disease (CVD) prediction, in-hospital mortality prediction, and ICU length-of-stay (LOS) regression. MedM2T outperformed state-of-the-art multimodal learning frameworks and existing time series models, achieving an AUROC of 0.947 and an AUPRC of 0.706 for CVD prediction; an AUROC of 0.901 and an AUPRC of 0.558 for mortality prediction; and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.31 for LOS regression. These results highlight the robustness and broad applicability of MedM2T, positioning it as a promising tool in clinical prediction. We provide the implementation of MedM2T at https:\/\/github.com\/DHLab-TSENG\/MedM2T."}

A solution to this problem can significantly reduce the documentation burden of clinicians and directly impact downstream patient care. We introduce the MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task, the first challenge on extracting medical orders from doctor-patient conversations. Six teams participated in the shared task and experimented with a broad range of approaches, and both closed- and open-weight large language models (LLMs).

{"title":"Estimating heritability of survival traits using censored multiple variance component model","abstract":"Characterizing the genetic basis of survival traits, such as age at disease onset, is critical for risk stratification, early intervention, and elucidating biological mechanisms that can inform therapeutic development. However, time-to-event outcomes in human cohorts are frequently right-censored, complicating both the estimation and partitioning of total heritability. Modern biobanks linked to electronic health records offer the unprecedented power to dissect the genetic basis of age-at-diagnosis traits at large scale. Yet, few methods exist for estimating and partitioning the total heritability of censored survival traits. Existing methods impose restrictive distributional assumptions on genetic and environmental effects and are not scalable to large biobanks with a million subjects. We introduce a censored multiple variance component model to robustly estimate the total heritability of survival traits under right-censoring. We demonstrate through extensive simulations that the method provides accurate total heritability estimates of right-censored traits at censoring rates up to 80% given sufficient sample size. The method is computationally efficient in estimating one hundred genetic variance components of a survival trait using large-scale biobank genotype data consisting of a million subjects and a million SNPs in under nine hours, including uncertainty quantification. We apply our method to estimate the total heritability of four age-at-diagnosis traits from the UK Biobank study. Our results establish a scalable and robust framework for heritability analysis of right-censored survival traits in large-scale genetic studies."}
{"title":"Beyond Long Context: When Semantics Matter More than Tokens","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHR) store clinical documentation as base64 encoded attachments in FHIR DocumentReference resources, which makes semantic question answering difficult. Traditional vector database methods often miss nuanced clinical relationships. The Clinical Entity Augmented Retrieval (CLEAR) method, introduced by Lopez et al. 2025, uses entity aware retrieval and achieved improved performance with an F1 score of 0.90 versus 0.86 for embedding based retrieval, while using over 70 percent fewer tokens. We developed a Clinical Notes QA Evaluation Platform to validate CLEAR against zero shot large context inference and traditional chunk based retrieval augmented generation. The platform was tested on 12 clinical notes ranging from 10,000 to 65,000 tokens representing realistic EHR content. CLEAR achieved a 58.3 percent win rate, an average semantic similarity of 0.878, and used 78 percent fewer tokens than wide context processing. The largest performance gains occurred on long notes, with a 75 percent win rate for documents exceeding 65,000 tokens. These findings confirm that entity aware retrieval improves both efficiency and accuracy in clinical natural language processing. The evaluation framework provides a reusable and transparent benchmark for assessing clinical question answering systems where semantic precision and computational efficiency are critical."}
{"title":"EHR-R1: A Reasoning-Enhanced Foundational Language Model for Electronic Health Record Analysis","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap, specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis. Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning 42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and achieving a 10\\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins, EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis."}
{"title":"Evolving Diagnostic Agents in a Virtual Clinical Environment","abstract":"In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models (LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34% higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by 7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone."}
{"title":"Generative AI for Healthcare: Fundamentals, Challenges, and Perspectives","abstract":"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is taking the world by storm. It promises transformative opportunities for advancing and disrupting existing practices, including healthcare. From large language models (LLMs) for clinical note synthesis and conversational assistance to multimodal systems that integrate medical imaging, electronic health records, and genomic data for decision support, GenAI is transforming the practice of medicine and the delivery of healthcare, such as diagnosis and personalized treatments, with great potential in reducing the cognitive burden on clinicians, thereby improving overall healthcare delivery. However, GenAI deployment in healthcare requires an in-depth understanding of healthcare tasks and what can and cannot be achieved. In this paper, we propose a data-centric paradigm in the design and deployment of GenAI systems for healthcare. Specifically, we reposition the data life cycle by making the medical data ecosystem as the foundational substrate for generative healthcare systems. This ecosystem is designed to sustainably support the integration, representation, and retrieval of diverse medical data and knowledge. With effective and efficient data processing pipelines, such as semantic vector search and contextual querying, it enables GenAI-powered operations for upstream model components and downstream clinical applications. Ultimately, it not only supplies foundation models with high-quality, multimodal data for large-scale pretraining and domain-specific fine-tuning, but also serves as a knowledge retrieval backend to support task-specific inference via the agentic layer. The ecosystem enables the deployment of GenAI for high-quality and effective healthcare delivery."}
{"title":"Predicting Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease using Machine Learning Methods","abstract":"Background: Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) affects ~33% of U.S. adults and is the most common chronic liver disease. Although often asymptomatic, progression can lead to cirrhosis. Early detection is important, as lifestyle interventions can prevent disease progression. We developed a fair, rigorous, and reproducible MASLD prediction model and compared it to prior methods using a large electronic health record database.\n  Methods: We evaluated LASSO logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, and a neural network for MASLD prediction using clinical feature subsets, including the top 10 SHAP-ranked features. To reduce disparities in true positive rates across racial and ethnic subgroups, we applied an equal opportunity postprocessing method.\n  Results: This study included 59,492 patients in the training data, 24,198 in the validating data, and 25,188 in the testing data. The LASSO logistic regression model with the top 10 features was selected for its interpretability and comparable performance. Before fairness adjustment, the model achieved AUROC of 0.84, accuracy of 78%, sensitivity of 72%, specificity of 79%, and F1-score of 0.617. After equal opportunity postprocessing, accuracy modestly increased to 81% and specificity to 94%, while sensitivity decreased to 41% and F1-score to 0.515, reflecting the fairness trade-off.\n  Conclusions: We developed the MASER prediction model (MASLD Static EHR Risk Prediction), a LASSO logistic regression model which achieved competitive performance for MASLD prediction (AUROC 0.836, accuracy 77.6%), comparable to previously reported ensemble and tree-based models. Overall, this approach demonstrates that interpretable models can achieve a balance of predictive performance and fairness in diverse patient populations."}
{"title":"Joint Score-Threshold Optimization for Interpretable Risk Assessment Under Partial Supervision","abstract":"Risk assessment tools in healthcare commonly employ point-based scoring systems that map patients to ordinal risk categories via thresholds. While electronic health record (EHR) data presents opportunities for data-driven optimization of these tools, two fundamental challenges impede standard supervised learning: (1) partial supervision arising from intervention-censored outcomes, where only extreme categories can be reliably labeled, and (2) asymmetric misclassification costs that increase with ordinal distance. We propose a mixed-integer programming (MIP) framework that jointly optimizes scoring weights and category thresholds under these constraints. Our approach handles partial supervision through per-instance feasible label sets, incorporates asymmetric distance-aware objectives, and prevents middle-category collapse via minimum threshold gaps. We further develop a CSO relaxation using softplus losses that preserves the ordinal structure while enabling efficient optimization. The framework supports governance constraints including sign restrictions, sparsity, and minimal modifications to incumbent tools, ensuring practical deployability in clinical workflows."}
{"title":"Integrating Genomics into Multimodal EHR Foundation Models","abstract":"This paper introduces an innovative Electronic Health Record (EHR) foundation model that integrates Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) as a foundational data modality, moving beyond traditional EHR-only approaches to build more holistic health profiles. Leveraging the extensive and diverse data from the All of Us (AoU) Research Program, this multimodal framework aims to learn complex relationships between clinical data and genetic predispositions. The methodology extends advancements in generative AI to the EHR foundation model space, enhancing predictive capabilities and interpretability. Evaluation on AoU data demonstrates the model's predictive value for the onset of various conditions, particularly Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), and illustrates the interplay between PRS and EHR data. The work also explores transfer learning for custom classification tasks, showcasing the architecture's versatility and efficiency. This approach is pivotal for unlocking new insights into disease prediction, proactive health management, risk stratification, and personalized treatment strategies, laying the groundwork for more personalized, equitable, and actionable real-world evidence generation in healthcare."}
{"title":"Chinese Discharge Drug Recommendation in Metabolic Diseases with Large Language Models","abstract":"Intelligent drug recommendation based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is critical for improving the quality and efficiency of clinical decision-making. By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and comorbidities. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in complex reasoning and medical text understanding, making them promising tools for drug recommendation tasks. However, the application of LLMs for Chinese clinical medication recommendation remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic investigation of LLM-based methodologies for Chinese discharge medication recommendation. We evaluate several representative LLM families (GLM, Llama, Qwen) under a unified methodological framework including zero-shot prompting, in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and supervised fine-tuning using LoRA. We analyze model behavior across reasoning styles, error patterns, domain adaptation mechanisms, and robustness. Experimental results show that while supervised fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard score of 0.4477. Our findings highlight both the potential and limitations of LLMs for Chinese drug recommendation."}
{"title":"Customizing Open Source LLMs for Quantitative Medication Attribute Extraction across Heterogeneous EHR Systems","abstract":"Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a standardized metric of medication coverage, \\emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study (25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall: Qwen2.5-32B achieves \\textbf{93.4\\%} coverage with \\textbf{93.0\\%} exact-match accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains \\textbf{93.1\\%}\/\\textbf{92.2\\%}. A brief error review highlights three common issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms, handling monthly\/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g., ``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle, site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence, and retention in real-world settings."}
{"title":"Automated Extraction of Fluoropyrimidine Treatment and Treatment-Related Toxicities from Clinical Notes Using Natural Language Processing","abstract":"Objective: Fluoropyrimidines are widely prescribed for colorectal and breast cancers, but are associated with toxicities such as hand-foot syndrome and cardiotoxicity. Since toxicity documentation is often embedded in clinical notes, we aimed to develop and evaluate natural language processing (NLP) methods to extract treatment and toxicity information.\n  Materials and Methods: We constructed a gold-standard dataset of 236 clinical notes from 204,165 adult oncology patients. Domain experts annotated categories related to treatment regimens and toxicities. We developed rule-based, machine learning-based (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine [SVM], Logistic Regression [LR]), deep learning-based (BERT, ClinicalBERT), and large language models (LLM)-based NLP approaches (zero-shot and error-analysis prompting). Models used an 80:20 train-test split.\n  Results: Sufficient data existed to train and evaluate 5 annotated categories. Error-analysis prompting achieved optimal precision, recall, and F1 scores (F1=1.000) for treatment and toxicities extraction, whereas zero-shot prompting reached F1=1.000 for treatment and F1=0.876 for toxicities extraction.LR and SVM ranked second for toxicities (F1=0.937). Deep learning underperformed, with BERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1= 0.839 toxicities) and ClinicalBERT (F1=0.873 treatment; F1 = 0.886 toxicities). Rule-based methods served as our baseline with F1 scores of 0.857 in treatment and 0.858 in toxicities.\n  Discussion: LMM-based approaches outperformed all others, followed by machine learning methods. Machine and deep learning approaches were limited by small training data and showed limited generalizability, particularly for rare categories.\n  Conclusion: LLM-based NLP most effectively extracted fluoropyrimidine treatment and toxicity information from clinical notes, and has strong potential to support oncology research and pharmacovigilance."}
{"title":"Optimizing Clinical Fall Risk Prediction: A Data-Driven Integration of EHR Variables with the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool","abstract":"In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208 admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables. The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression (AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings."}
{"title":"Asynchronous Distributed ECME Algorithm for Matrix Variate Non-Gaussian Responses","abstract":"We propose a regression model with matrix-variate skew-t response (REGMVST) for analyzing irregular longitudinal data with skewness, symmetry, or heavy tails. REGMVST models matrix-variate responses and predictors, with rows indexing longitudinal measurements per subject. It uses the matrix-variate skew-t (MVST) distribution to handle skewness and heavy tails, a damped exponential correlation (DEC) structure for row-wise dependencies across irregular time profiles, and leaves the column covariance unstructured. For estimation, we initially develop an ECME algorithm for parameter estimation and further mitigate its computational bottleneck via an asynchronous and distributed ECME (ADECME) extension. ADECME accelerates the E-step through parallelization, and retains the simplicity of the conditional M-step, enabling scalable inference. Simulations using synthetic data and a case study exploring matrix-variate periodontal disease endpoints derived from electronic health records demonstrate ADECME's superiority in efficiency and convergence, over the alternatives. We also provide theoretical support for our empirical observations and identify regularity assumptions for ADECME's optimal performance. An accompanying R package is available at https:\/\/github.com\/rh8liuqy\/STMATREG."}
{"title":"Automated HIV Screening on Dutch Electronic Health Records with Large Language Models","abstract":"Efficient screening and early diagnosis of HIV are critical for reducing onward transmission. Although large scale laboratory testing is not feasible, the widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offers new opportunities to address this challenge. Existing research primarily focuses on applying machine learning methods to structured data, such as patient demographics, for improving HIV diagnosis. However, these approaches often overlook unstructured text data such as clinical notes, which potentially contain valuable information relevant to HIV risk. In this study, we propose a novel pipeline that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze unstructured EHR text and determine a patient's eligibility for further HIV testing. Experimental results on clinical data from Erasmus University Medical Center Rotterdam demonstrate that our pipeline achieved high accuracy while maintaining a low false negative rate."}
{"title":"Local Obfuscation by GLINER for Impartial Context Aware Lineage: Development and evaluation of PII Removal system","abstract":"Removing Personally Identifiable Information (PII) from clinical notes in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is essential for research and AI development. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful, their high computational costs and the data privacy risks of API-based services limit their use, especially in low-resource settings. To address this, we developed LOGICAL (Local Obfuscation by GLINER for Impartial Context-Aware Lineage), an efficient, locally deployable PII removal system built on a fine-tuned Generalist and Lightweight Named Entity Recognition (GLiNER) model. We used 1515 clinical documents from a psychiatric hospital's EHR system. We defined nine PII categories for removal. A modern-gliner-bi-large-v1.0 model was fine-tuned on 2849 text instances and evaluated on a test set of 376 instances using character-level precision, recall, and F1-score. We compared its performance against Microsoft Azure NER, Microsoft Presidio, and zero-shot prompting with Gemini-Pro-2.5 and Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct. The fine-tuned GLiNER model achieved superior performance, with an overall micro-average F1-score of 0.980, significantly outperforming Gemini-Pro-2.5 (F1-score: 0.845). LOGICAL correctly sanitised 95% of documents completely, compared to 64% for the next-best solution. The model operated efficiently on a standard laptop without a dedicated GPU. However, a 2% entity-level false negative rate underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation across all tested systems. Fine-tuned, specialised transformer models like GLiNER offer an accurate, computationally efficient, and secure solution for PII removal from clinical notes. This \"sanitisation at the source\" approach is a practical alternative to resource-intensive LLMs, enabling the creation of de-identified datasets for research and AI development while preserving data privacy, particularly in resource-constrained environments."}
{"title":"Exploring Membership Inference Vulnerabilities in Clinical Large Language Models","abstract":"As large language models (LLMs) become progressively more embedded in clinical decision-support, documentation, and patient-information systems, ensuring their privacy and trustworthiness has emerged as an imperative challenge for the healthcare sector. Fine-tuning LLMs on sensitive electronic health record (EHR) data improves domain alignment but also raises the risk of exposing patient information through model behaviors. In this work-in-progress, we present an exploratory empirical study on membership inference vulnerabilities in clinical LLMs, focusing on whether adversaries can infer if specific patient records were used during model training. Using a state-of-the-art clinical question-answering model, Llemr, we evaluate both canonical loss-based attacks and a domain-motivated paraphrasing-based perturbation strategy that more realistically reflects clinical adversarial conditions. Our preliminary findings reveal limited but measurable membership leakage, suggesting that current clinical LLMs provide partial resistance yet remain susceptible to subtle privacy risks that could undermine trust in clinical AI adoption. These results motivate continued development of context-aware, domain-specific privacy evaluations and defenses such as differential privacy fine-tuning and paraphrase-aware training, to strengthen the security and trustworthiness of healthcare AI systems."}
{"title":"Enhancing mortality prediction in cardiac arrest ICU patients through meta-modeling of structured clinical data from MIMIC-IV","abstract":"Accurate early prediction of in-hospital mortality in intensive care units (ICUs) is essential for timely clinical intervention and efficient resource allocation. This study develops and evaluates machine learning models that integrate both structured clinical data and unstructured textual information, specifically discharge summaries and radiology reports, from the MIMIC-IV database. We used LASSO and XGBoost for feature selection, followed by a multivariate logistic regression trained on the top features identified by both models. Incorporating textual features using TF-IDF and BERT embeddings significantly improved predictive performance. The final logistic regression model, which combined structured and textual input, achieved an AUC of 0.918, compared to 0.753 when using structured data alone, a relative improvement 22%. The analysis of the decision curve demonstrated a superior standardized net benefit in a wide range of threshold probabilities (0.2-0.8), confirming the clinical utility of the model. These results underscore the added prognostic value of unstructured clinical notes and support their integration into interpretable feature-driven risk prediction models for ICU patients."}
{"title":"Multilingual Clinical NER for Diseases and Medications Recognition in Cardiology Texts using BERT Embeddings","abstract":"The rapidly increasing volume of electronic health record (EHR) data underscores a pressing need to unlock biomedical knowledge from unstructured clinical texts to support advancements in data-driven clinical systems, including patient diagnosis, disease progression monitoring, treatment effects assessment, prediction of future clinical events, etc. While contextualized language models have demonstrated impressive performance improvements for named entity recognition (NER) systems in English corpora, there remains a scarcity of research focused on clinical texts in low-resource languages. To bridge this gap, our study aims to develop multiple deep contextual embedding models to enhance clinical NER in the cardiology domain, as part of the BioASQ MultiCardioNER shared task. We explore the effectiveness of different monolingual and multilingual BERT-based models, trained on general domain text, for extracting disease and medication mentions from clinical case reports written in English, Spanish, and Italian. We achieved an F1-score of 77.88% on Spanish Diseases Recognition (SDR), 92.09% on Spanish Medications Recognition (SMR), 91.74% on English Medications Recognition (EMR), and 88.9% on Italian Medications Recognition (IMR). These results outperform the mean and median F1 scores in the test leaderboard across all subtasks, with the mean\/median values being: 69.61%\/75.66% for SDR, 81.22%\/90.18% for SMR, 89.2%\/88.96% for EMR, and 82.8%\/87.76% for IMR."}
{"title":"Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural ODEs for Type 2 Diabetes Progression Modeling","abstract":"Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's disease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2 diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event samples and patient heterogeneity (\\eg different progression rates and pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework. TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases."}
{"title":"Unified Peripartum Database with Natural-Language-to-SQL Capabilities at Udine University Hospital: Design and Prototype","abstract":"The fragmentation of obstetric information across electronic health record modules, device repositories, and laboratory systems, as it is common in hospitals, hinders both intrapartum care and reproducible research. In this work, we present a practical blueprint for transforming heterogeneous peripartum records into computable, queryable assets by designing and prototyping a unified peripartum relational database with natural-language-to-SQL (NL2SQL) capabilities at the Obstetrics Clinic of Udine University Hospital. Requirements were co-defined with clinicians and formalized as an Entity-Relationship diagram, from which the logical schema and SQL implementation of the database were then derived. The latter integrates heterogeneous sources to connect maternal anamnestic and longitudinal history, current-pregnancy findings, intrapartum course, and delivery and neonatal outcomes. The NL2SQL layer enables clinicians to pose natural-language queries to the system, lowering barriers to audit and exploratory analysis."}
{"title":"Towards Automatic Evaluation and Selection of PHI De-identification Models via Multi-Agent Collaboration","abstract":"Protected health information (PHI) de-identification is critical for enabling the safe reuse of clinical notes, yet evaluating and comparing PHI de-identification models typically depends on costly, small-scale expert annotations. We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure de-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy reliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each independently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting structured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based majority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a single, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels are limited."}

From the full CheXpert corpus of 224,316 chest radiographs, we randomly selected 234 radiologist-annotated studies to evaluate unimodal performance using image-only prompts. In this setting, ChatGPT and Claude achieved diagnostic accuracies of 62.8% and 76.9%, respectively. A similarity-based consensus approach, using a 95% output similarity threshold, improved accuracy to 77.6%. To assess the impact of multimodal inputs, we then generated synthetic clinical notes following the MIMIC-CXR template and evaluated a separate subset of 50 randomly selected cases paired with both images and synthetic text. On this multimodal cohort, performance improved to 84% for ChatGPT and 76% for Claude, while consensus accuracy reached 91.3%. Across both experimental conditions, agreement-based fusion consistently outperformed individual models. These findings highlight the utility of integrating complementary modalities and using output-level consensus to improve the trustworthiness and clinical utility of AI-assisted radiological diagnosis, offering a practical path to reduce diagnostic errors with minimal computational overhead."}

{"title":"LTR-ICD: A Learning-to-Rank Approach for Automatic ICD Coding","abstract":"Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging. State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics, the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904, respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and 0.2660."}
{"title":"Fast Authenticated and Interoperable Multimedia Healthcare Data over Hybrid-Storage Blockchains","abstract":"The integration of blockchain technology into healthcare presents a paradigm shift for secure data management, enabling decentralized and tamper-proof storage and sharing of sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, existing blockchain-based healthcare systems, while providing robust access control, commonly overlook the high latency in user-side re-computation of hashes for integrity verification of large multimedia data, impairing their practicality, especially in time-sensitive clinical scenarios. In this paper, we propose FAITH, an innovative scheme for \\underline{F}ast \\underline{A}uthenticated and \\underline{I}nteroperable mul\\underline{T}imedia \\underline{H}ealthcare data storage and sharing over hybrid-storage blockchains. Rather than user-side hash re-computations, FAITH lets an off-chain storage provider generate verifiable proofs using recursive Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), while the user only needs to perform lightweight verification. For flexible access authorization, we leverage Proxy Re-Encryption (PRE) and enable the provider to conduct ciphertext re-encryption, in which the re-encryption correctness can be verified via ZKPs against the malicious provider. All metadata and proofs are recorded on-chain for public verification. We provide a comprehensive analysis of FAITH's security regarding data privacy and integrity. We implemented a prototype of FAITH, and extensive experiments demonstrated its practicality for time-critical healthcare applications, dramatically reducing user-side verification latency by up to $98\\%$, bringing it from $4$ s down to around $70$ ms for a $5$ GB encrypted file."}

Our framework includes methods for probing memorization at both the embedding and generative levels, and aims to distinguish between model generalization and harmful memorization in clinically relevant settings. We contextualize memorization in terms of its potential to compromise patient privacy, particularly for vulnerable subgroups.

{"title":"Multimodal Disease Progression Modeling via Spatiotemporal Disentanglement and Multiscale Alignment","abstract":"Longitudinal multimodal data, including electronic health records (EHR) and sequential chest X-rays (CXRs), is critical for modeling disease progression, yet remains underutilized due to two key challenges: (1) redundancy in consecutive CXR sequences, where static anatomical regions dominate over clinically-meaningful dynamics, and (2) temporal misalignment between sparse, irregular imaging and continuous EHR data. We introduce $\\texttt{DiPro}$, a novel framework that addresses these challenges through region-aware disentanglement and multi-timescale alignment. First, we disentangle static (anatomy) and dynamic (pathology progression) features in sequential CXRs, prioritizing disease-relevant changes. Second, we hierarchically align these static and dynamic CXR features with asynchronous EHR data via local (pairwise interval-level) and global (full-sequence) synchronization to model coherent progression pathways. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC dataset demonstrate that $\\texttt{DiPro}$ could effectively extract temporal clinical dynamics and achieve state-of-the-art performance on both disease progression identification and general ICU prediction tasks."}
{"title":"Transfer Learning with Distance Covariance for Random Forest: Error Bounds and an EHR Application","abstract":"Random forest is an important method for ML applications due to its broad outperformance over competing methods for structured tabular data. We propose a method for transfer learning in nonparametric regression using a centered random forest (CRF) with distance covariance-based feature weights, assuming the unknown source and target regression functions are different for a few features (sparsely different). Our method first obtains residuals from predicting the response in the target domain using a source domain-trained CRF. Then, we fit another CRF to the residuals, but with feature splitting probabilities proportional to the sample distance covariance between the features and the residuals in an independent sample. We derive an upper bound on the mean square error rate of the procedure as a function of sample sizes and difference dimension, theoretically demonstrating transfer learning benefits in random forests. In simulations, we show that the results obtained for the CRFs also hold numerically for the standard random forest (SRF) method with data-driven feature split selection. Beyond transfer learning, our results also show the benefit of distance-covariance-based weights on the performance of RF in some situations. Our method shows significant gains in predicting the mortality of ICU patients in smaller-bed target hospitals using a large multi-hospital dataset of electronic health records for 200,000 ICU patients."}
{"title":"Assessing Large Language Models for Structured Medical Order Extraction","abstract":"Medical order extraction is essential for structuring actionable clinical information, supporting decision-making, and enabling downstream applications such as documentation and workflow automation. Orders may be embedded in diverse sources, including electronic health records, discharge summaries, and multi-turn doctor-patient dialogues, and can span categories such as medications, laboratory tests, imaging studies, and follow-up actions. The MEDIQA-OE 2025 shared task focuses on extracting structured medical orders from extended conversational transcripts, requiring the identification of order type, description, reason, and provenance. We present the MasonNLP submission, which ranked 5th among 17 participating teams with 105 total submissions. Our approach uses a general-purpose, instruction-tuned LLaMA-4 17B model without domain-specific fine-tuning, guided by a single in-context example. This few-shot configuration achieved an average F1 score of 37.76, with notable improvements in reason and provenance accuracy. These results demonstrate that large, non-domain-specific LLMs, when paired with effective prompt engineering, can serve as strong, scalable baselines for specialized clinical NLP tasks."}
{"title":"Traj-CoA: Patient Trajectory Modeling via Chain-of-Agents for Lung Cancer Risk Prediction","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) offer a generalizable approach for modeling patient trajectories, but suffer from the long and noisy nature of electronic health records (EHR) data in temporal reasoning. To address these challenges, we introduce Traj-CoA, a multi-agent system involving chain-of-agents for patient trajectory modeling. Traj-CoA employs a chain of worker agents to process EHR data in manageable chunks sequentially, distilling critical events into a shared long-term memory module, EHRMem, to reduce noise and preserve a comprehensive timeline. A final manager agent synthesizes the worker agents' summary and the extracted timeline in EHRMem to make predictions. In a zero-shot one-year lung cancer risk prediction task based on five-year EHR data, Traj-CoA outperforms baselines of four categories. Analysis reveals that Traj-CoA exhibits clinically aligned temporal reasoning, establishing it as a promisingly robust and generalizable approach for modeling complex patient trajectories."}
{"title":"Serialized EHR make for good text representations","abstract":"The emergence of foundation models in healthcare has opened new avenues for learning generalizable representations from large scale clinical data. Yet, existing approaches often struggle to reconcile the tabular and event based nature of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with the sequential priors of natural language models. This structural mismatch limits their ability to capture longitudinal dependencies across patient encounters. We introduce SerialBEHRT, a domain aligned foundation model that extends SciBERT through additional pretraining on structured EHR sequences. SerialBEHRT is designed to encode temporal and contextual relationships among clinical events, thereby producing richer patient representations. We evaluate its effectiveness on the task of antibiotic susceptibility prediction, a clinically meaningful problem in antibiotic stewardship. Through extensive benchmarking against state of the art EHR representation strategies, we demonstrate that SerialBEHRT achieves superior and more consistent performance, highlighting the importance of temporal serialization in foundation model pretraining for healthcare."}
{"title":"Large scale statistically validated comorbidity networks","abstract":"We obtain comorbidity networks starting from medical information stored in electronic health records collected by the Wellbeing Services County of Southwest Finland (Varha). Based on the data, we associate each patient to one or more diseases and construct complex comorbidity networks associated with large patient cohorts characterized by an age interval and sex. The information about diseases in electronic health records is coded using the highest granularity present in the international classification of diseases (ICD codes) provided by the World Health Organization. We statistically validate links in each cohort comorbidity network and furthermore partition the networks into communities of diseases. These are characterized by the over-expression of a few disease categories, and communities from different age or sex cohorts show various similarities in terms of these disease classes. Moreover, all the detected communities for all the cohorts can be organized into a hierarchical tree. This allows us to observe a number of clusters of communities, originating from diverse age and sex cohorts, that group together communities characterized by the same disease classes. We also perform a dismantling procedure of statistically validated comorbidity networks to highlight those categories of diseases that are most responsible for the compactedness of the comorbidity networks for a given cohort of patients."}
{"title":"Cross-Representation Benchmarking in Time-Series Electronic Health Records for Clinical Outcome Prediction","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs. This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping) and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and data regime."}
{"title":"DeepEN: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Personalized Enteral Nutrition in Critical Care","abstract":"ICU enteral feeding remains sub-optimal due to limited personalization and uncertainty about appropriate calorie, protein, and fluid targets, particularly under rapidly changing metabolic demands and heterogeneous patient responses. This study introduces DeepEN, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework that personalizes enteral nutrition (EN) dosing for critically ill patients using electronic health record data. DeepEN was trained on over 11,000 ICU patients from the MIMIC-IV database to generate 4-hourly, patient-specific targets for caloric, protein, and fluid intake. The model's state space integrates demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, laboratory results, and prior interventions relevant to nutritional management, while its reward function balances short-term physiological and nutrition-related goals with long-term survival. A dueling double deep Q-network with Conservative Q-Learning regularization is used to ensure safe and reliable policy learning from retrospective data. DeepEN achieved a 3.7 $\\pm$ 0.17 percentage-point absolute reduction in estimated mortality compared with the clinician policy (18.8% vs 22.5%) and higher expected returns compared with guideline-based dosing (11.89 vs 8.11), with improvements in key nutritional biomarkers. U-shaped associations between deviations from clinician dosing and mortality suggest that the learned policy aligns with high-value clinician actions while diverging from suboptimal ones. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of conservative offline RL for individualized EN therapy and suggest that data-driven personalization may improve outcomes beyond guideline- or heuristic-based approaches."}
{"title":"Toward Reliable Clinical Coding with Language Models: Verification and Lightweight Adaptation","abstract":"Accurate clinical coding is essential for healthcare documentation, billing, and decision-making. While prior work shows that off-the-shelf LLMs struggle with this task, evaluations based on exact match metrics often overlook errors where predicted codes are hierarchically close but incorrect. Our analysis reveals that such hierarchical misalignments account for a substantial portion of LLM failures. We show that lightweight interventions, including prompt engineering and small-scale fine-tuning, can improve accuracy without the computational overhead of search-based methods. To address hierarchically near-miss errors, we introduce clinical code verification as both a standalone task and a pipeline component. To mitigate the limitations in existing datasets, such as incomplete evidence and inpatient bias in MIMIC, we release an expert double-annotated benchmark of outpatient clinical notes with ICD-10 codes. Our results highlight verification as an effective and reliable step toward improving LLM-based medical coding."}
{"title":"Generalizing Multimorbidity Models Across Countries: A Comparative Study of Austria and Denmark","abstract":"Chronic diseases frequently co-occur in patterns that are unlikely to arise by chance, a phenomenon known as multimorbidity. This growing challenge for patients and healthcare systems is amplified by demographic aging and the rising burden of chronic conditions. However, our understanding of how individuals transition from a disease-free-state to accumulating diseases as they age is limited. Recently, data-driven methods have been developed to characterize morbidity trajectories using electronic health records; however, their generalizability across healthcare settings remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we conduct a cross-country validation of a data-driven multimorbidity trajectory model using population-wide health data from Denmark and Austria. Despite considerable differences in healthcare organization, we observe a high degree of similarity in disease cluster structures. The Adjusted Rand Index (0.998) and the Normalized Mutual Information (0.88) both indicate strong alignment between the two clusterings. These findings suggest that multimorbidity trajectories are shaped by robust, shared biological and epidemiological mechanisms that transcend national healthcare contexts."}
{"title":"Evaluating and Learning Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes under Truncation by Death","abstract":"Truncation by death, a prevalent challenge in critical care, renders traditional dynamic treatment regime (DTR) evaluation inapplicable due to ill-defined potential outcomes. We introduce a principal stratification-based method, focusing on the always-survivor value function. We derive a semiparametrically efficient, multiply robust estimator for multi-stage DTRs, demonstrating its robustness and efficiency. Empirical validation and an application to electronic health records showcase its utility for personalized treatment optimization."}
{"title":"Cancer Diagnosis Categorization in Electronic Health Records Using Large Language Models and BioBERT: Model Performance Evaluation Study","abstract":"Electronic health records contain inconsistently structured or free-text data, requiring efficient preprocessing to enable predictive health care models. Although artificial intelligence-driven natural language processing tools show promise for automating diagnosis classification, their comparative performance and clinical reliability require systematic evaluation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the performance of 4 large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, Llama 3.2, and Gemini 1.5) and BioBERT in classifying cancer diagnoses from structured and unstructured electronic health records data. We analyzed 762 unique diagnoses (326 International Classification of Diseases (ICD) code descriptions, 436free-text entries) from 3456 records of patients with cancer. Models were tested on their ability to categorize diagnoses into 14predefined categories. Two oncology experts validated classifications. BioBERT achieved the highest weighted macro F1-score for ICD codes (84.2) and matched GPT-4o in ICD code accuracy (90.8). For free-text diagnoses, GPT-4o outperformed BioBERT in weighted macro F1-score (71.8 vs 61.5) and achieved slightly higher accuracy (81.9 vs 81.6). GPT-3.5, Gemini, and Llama showed lower overall performance on both formats. Common misclassification patterns included confusion between metastasis and central nervous system tumors, as well as errors involving ambiguous or overlapping clinical terminology. Although current performance levels appear sufficient for administrative and research use, reliable clinical applications will require standardized documentation practices alongside robust human oversight for high-stakes decision-making."}
{"title":"Discrete Diffusion Models with MLLMs for Unified Medical Multimodal Generation","abstract":"Recent advances in generative medical models are constrained by modality-specific scenarios that hinder the integration of complementary evidence from imaging, pathology, and clinical notes. This fragmentation limits their evolution into foundation models that can learn and reason across the full spectrum of biomedical data. We propose MeDiM, the first medical discrete diffusion model that learns shared distributions across modalities without modality-specific components. MeDiM unifies multiple generative tasks: translating between images and text, and jointly producing image-report pairs across domains in response to prompts. Built on a discrete diffusion framework, MeDiM bridges vision and language representations through a shared probabilistic space. To enable unified and flexible medical generation, we employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) as the diffusion backbone, leveraging its prior knowledge and cross-modal reasoning. Two key designs are introduced: (1) removing the causal attention mask for bidirectional context, and (2) injecting continuous timestep embeddings for diffusion awareness. Experiments demonstrate high-fidelity medical generation (FID 16.60 on MIMIC-CXR and FID 24.19 on PathGen) and accurate report generation (METEOR 0.2650 and 0.2580). Jointly generated image-report pairs further enhance downstream performance (plus6.43 percent BLEU-1, plus18.57 percent BLEU-2, plus31.58 percent BLEU-3, plus4.80 percent METEOR), showing that MeDiM supports coherent and clinically grounded multimodal outputs."}
{"title":"A Review of Ontology-Driven Big Data Analytics in Healthcare: Challenges, Tools, and Applications","abstract":"Exponential growth in heterogeneous healthcare data arising from electronic health records (EHRs), medical imaging, wearable sensors, and biomedical research has accelerated the adoption of data lakes and centralized architectures capable of handling the Volume, Variety, and Velocity of Big Data for advanced analytics. However, without effective governance, these repositories risk devolving into disorganized data swamps. Ontology-driven semantic data management offers a robust solution by linking metadata to healthcare knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing semantic interoperability, improving data discoverability, and enabling expressive, domain-aware access. This review adopts a systematic research strategy, formulating key research questions and conducting a structured literature search across major academic databases, with selected studies analyzed and classified into six categories of ontology-driven healthcare analytics: (i) ontology-driven integration frameworks, (ii) semantic modeling for metadata enrichment, (iii) ontology-based data access (OBDA), (iv) basic semantic data management, (v) ontology-based reasoning for decision support, and (vi) semantic annotation for unstructured data. We further examine the integration of ontology technologies with Big Data frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, and so on, highlighting their combined potential to deliver scalable and intelligent healthcare analytics. For each category, recent techniques, representative case studies, technical and organizational challenges, and emerging trends such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, the Internet of Things (IoT), and real-time analytics are reviewed to guide the development of sustainable, interoperable, and high-performance healthcare data ecosystems."}
{"title":"Ocular-Induced Abnormal Head Posture: Diagnosis and Missing Data Imputation","abstract":"Ocular-induced abnormal head posture (AHP) is a compensatory mechanism that arises from ocular misalignment conditions, such as strabismus, enabling patients to reduce diplopia and preserve binocular vision. Early diagnosis minimizes morbidity and secondary complications such as facial asymmetry; however, current clinical assessments remain largely subjective and are further complicated by incomplete medical records. This study addresses both challenges through two complementary deep learning frameworks. First, AHP-CADNet is a multi-level attention fusion framework for automated diagnosis that integrates ocular landmarks, head pose features, and structured clinical attributes to generate interpretable predictions. Second, a curriculum learning-based imputation framework is designed to mitigate missing data by progressively leveraging structured variables and unstructured clinical notes to enhance diagnostic robustness under realistic data conditions. Evaluation on the PoseGaze-AHP dataset demonstrates robust diagnostic performance. AHP-CADNet achieves 96.9-99.0 percent accuracy across classification tasks and low prediction errors for continuous variables, with MAE ranging from 0.103 to 0.199 and R2 exceeding 0.93. The imputation framework maintains high accuracy across all clinical variables (93.46-99.78 percent with PubMedBERT), with clinical dependency modeling yielding significant improvements (p < 0.001). These findings confirm the effectiveness of both frameworks for automated diagnosis and recovery from missing data in clinical settings."}
{"title":"Aligning Language Models with Clinical Expertise: DPO for Heart Failure Nursing Documentation in Critical Care","abstract":"Nursing documentation in intensive care units (ICUs) provides essential clinical intelligence but often suffers from inconsistent terminology, informal styles, and lack of standardization, challenges that are particularly critical in heart failure care. This study applies Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to adapt Mistral-7B, a locally deployable language model, using 8,838 heart failure nursing notes from the MIMIC-III database and 21,210 preference pairs derived from expert-verified GPT outputs, model generations, and original notes. Evaluation across BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Perplexity, and expert qualitative assessments demonstrates that DPO markedly enhances documentation quality. Specifically, BLEU increased by 84% (0.173 to 0.318), BERTScore improved by 7.6% (0.828 to 0.891), and expert ratings rose across accuracy (+14.4 points), completeness (+14.5 points), logical consistency (+14.1 points), readability (+11.1 points), and structural clarity (+6.0 points). These results indicate that DPO can align lightweight clinical language models with expert standards, supporting privacy-preserving, AI-assisted documentation within electronic health record systems to reduce administrative burden and improve ICU patient safety."}
{"title":"Revealing Interconnections between Diseases: from Statistical Methods to Large Language Models","abstract":"Identifying disease interconnections through manual analysis of large-scale clinical data is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to expert disagreement. While machine learning (ML) shows promise, three critical challenges remain: (1) selecting optimal methods from the vast ML landscape, (2) determining whether real-world clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, EHRs) or structured disease descriptions yield more reliable insights, (3) the lack of \"ground truth,\" as some disease interconnections remain unexplored in medicine. Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate broad utility, yet they often lack specialized medical knowledge. To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic evaluation of seven approaches for uncovering disease relationships based on two data sources: (i) sequences of ICD-10 codes from MIMIC-IV EHRs and (ii) the full set of ICD-10 codes, both with and without textual descriptions. Our framework integrates the following: (i) a statistical co-occurrence analysis and a masked language modeling (MLM) approach using real clinical data; (ii) domain-specific BERT variants (Med-BERT and BioClinicalBERT); (iii) a general-purpose BERT and document retrieval; and (iv) four LLMs (Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, and YandexGPT). Our graph-based comparison of the obtained interconnection matrices shows that the LLM-based approach produces interconnections with the lowest diversity of ICD code connections to different diseases compared to other methods, including text-based and domain-based approaches. This suggests an important implication: LLMs have limited potential for discovering new interconnections. In the absence of ground truth databases for medical interconnections between ICD codes, our results constitute a valuable medical disease ontology that can serve as a foundational resource for future clinical research and artificial intelligence applications in healthcare."}
{"title":"RareGraph-Synth: Knowledge-Guided Diffusion Models for Generating Privacy-Preserving Synthetic Patient Trajectories in Ultra-Rare Diseases","abstract":"We propose RareGraph-Synth, a knowledge-guided, continuous-time diffusion framework that generates realistic yet privacy-preserving synthetic electronic-health-record (EHR) trajectories for ultra-rare diseases. RareGraph-Synth unifies five public resources: Orphanet\/Orphadata, the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), the GARD rare-disease KG, PrimeKG, and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) into a heterogeneous knowledge graph comprising approximately 8 M typed edges. Meta-path scores extracted from this 8-million-edge KG modulate the per-token noise schedule in the forward stochastic differential equation, steering generation toward biologically plausible lab-medication-adverse-event co-occurrences while retaining score-based diffusion model stability. The reverse denoiser then produces timestamped sequences of lab-code, medication-code, and adverse-event-flag triples that contain no protected health information. On simulated ultra-rare-disease cohorts, RareGraph-Synth lowers categorical Maximum Mean Discrepancy by 40 percent relative to an unguided diffusion baseline and by greater than 60 percent versus GAN counterparts, without sacrificing downstream predictive utility. A black-box membership-inference evaluation using the DOMIAS attacker yields AUROC approximately 0.53, well below the 0.55 safe-release threshold and substantially better than the approximately 0.61 plus or minus 0.03 observed for non-KG baselines, demonstrating strong resistance to re-identification. These results suggest that integrating biomedical knowledge graphs directly into diffusion noise schedules can simultaneously enhance fidelity and privacy, enabling safer data sharing for rare-disease research."}
{"title":"Dual-stage and Lightweight Patient Chart Summarization for Emergency Physicians","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) contain extensive unstructured clinical data that can overwhelm emergency physicians trying to identify critical information. We present a two-stage summarization system that runs entirely on embedded devices, enabling offline clinical summarization while preserving patient privacy. In our approach, a dual-device architecture first retrieves relevant patient record sections using the Jetson Nano-R (Retrieve), then generates a structured summary on another Jetson Nano-S (Summarize), communicating via a lightweight socket link. The summarization output is two-fold: (1) a fixed-format list of critical findings, and (2) a context-specific narrative focused on the clinician's query. The retrieval stage uses locally stored EHRs, splits long notes into semantically coherent sections, and searches for the most relevant sections per query. The generation stage uses a locally hosted small language model (SLM) to produce the summary from the retrieved text, operating within the constraints of two NVIDIA Jetson devices. We first benchmarked six open-source SLMs under 7B parameters to identify viable models. We incorporated an LLM-as-Judge evaluation mechanism to assess summary quality in terms of factual accuracy, completeness, and clarity. Preliminary results on MIMIC-IV and de-identified real EHRs demonstrate that our fully offline system can effectively produce useful summaries in under 30 seconds."}
{"title":"Increasing LLM response trustworthiness using voting ensembles","abstract":"Despite huge advances, LLMs still lack convenient and reliable methods to quantify the uncertainty in their responses, making them difficult to trust in high-stakes applications. One of the simplest approaches to eliciting more accurate answers is to select the mode of many responses, a technique known as ensembling. In this work, we expand on typical ensembling approaches by looking at ensembles with a variable voting threshold. We introduce a theoretical framework for question answering and show that, by permitting ensembles to \"abstain\" from providing an answer when the dominant response falls short of the threshold, it is possible to dramatically increase the trustworthiness of the remaining answers. From this framework, we derive theoretical results as well as report experimental results on two problem domains: arithmetic problem solving and clinical-note question-answering. In both domains, we observe that large gains in answer trustworthiness can be achieved using highly restrictive voting ensembles, while incurring relatively modest reductions in response yield and accuracy. Due to this quality, voting ensembles may be particularly useful in applications - such as healthcare and data annotation - that require a high degree of certainty but which may not require that every question receive an automated answer."}
{"title":"On Using Large Language Models to Enhance Clinically-Driven Missing Data Recovery Algorithms in Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) data are prone to missingness and errors. Previously, we devised an \"enriched\" chart review protocol where a \"roadmap\" of auxiliary diagnoses (anchors) was used to recover missing values in EHR data (e.g., a diagnosis of impaired glycemic control might imply that a missing hemoglobin A1c value would be considered unhealthy). Still, chart reviews are expensive and time-intensive, which limits the number of patients whose data can be reviewed. Now, we investigate the accuracy and scalability of a roadmap-driven algorithm, based on ICD-10 codes (International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision), to mimic expert chart reviews and recover missing values. Materials and Methods: In addition to the clinicians' original roadmap from our previous work, we consider new versions that were iteratively refined using large language models (LLM) in conjunction with clinical expertise to expand the list of auxiliary diagnoses. Using chart reviews for 100 patients from the EHR at an extensive learning health system, we examine algorithm performance with different roadmaps. Using the larger study of $1000$ patients, we applied the final algorithm, which used a roadmap with clinician-approved additions from the LLM. Results: The algorithm recovered as much, if not more, missing data as the expert chart reviewers, depending on the roadmap. Discussion: Clinically-driven algorithms (enhanced by LLM) can recover missing EHR data with similar accuracy to chart reviews and can feasibly be applied to large samples. Extending them to monitor other dimensions of data quality (e.g., plausability) is a promising future direction."}
{"title":"DuPLUS: Dual-Prompt Vision-Language Framework for Universal Medical Image Segmentation and Prognosis","abstract":"Deep learning for medical imaging is hampered by task-specific models that lack generalizability and prognostic capabilities, while existing 'universal' approaches suffer from simplistic conditioning and poor medical semantic understanding. To address these limitations, we introduce DuPLUS, a deep learning framework for efficient multi-modal medical image analysis. DuPLUS introduces a novel vision-language framework that leverages hierarchical semantic prompts for fine-grained control over the analysis task, a capability absent in prior universal models. To enable extensibility to other medical tasks, it includes a hierarchical, text-controlled architecture driven by a unique dual-prompt mechanism. For segmentation, DuPLUS is able to generalize across three imaging modalities, ten different anatomically various medical datasets, encompassing more than 30 organs and tumor types. It outperforms the state-of-the-art task specific and universal models on 8 out of 10 datasets. We demonstrate extensibility of its text-controlled architecture by seamless integration of electronic health record (EHR) data for prognosis prediction, and on a head and neck cancer dataset, DuPLUS achieved a Concordance Index (CI) of 0.69. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks and modalities from varying centers, establishing DuPLUS as a versatile and clinically relevant solution for medical image analysis. The code for this work is made available at: https:\/\/anonymous.4open.science\/r\/DuPLUS-6C52"}
{"title":"Deciphering the influence of demographic factors on the treatment of pediatric patients in the emergency department","abstract":"Persistent demographic disparities have been identified in the treatment of patients seeking care in the emergency department (ED). These may be driven in part by subconscious biases, which providers themselves may struggle to identify. To better understand the operation of these biases, we performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis using electronic health records describing 339,400 visits to the ED of a single US pediatric medical center between 2019-2024. Odds ratios were calculated using propensity-score matching. Analyses were adjusted for confounding variables, including chief complaint, insurance type, socio-economic deprivation, and patient comorbidities. We also trained a machine learning [ML] model on this dataset to identify predictors of admission. We found significant demographic disparities in admission (Non-Hispanic Black [NHB] relative to Non-Hispanic White [NHW]: OR 0.77, 95\\% CI 0.73-0.81; Hispanic relative to NHW: OR 0.80, 95\\% CI 0.76-0.83). We also identified disparities in individual decisions taken during the ED stay. For example, NHB patients were significantly less likely than NHW patients to be assigned an `emergent' triage acuity score of (OR 0.70, 95\\% CI 0.67-0.72), but emergent NHB patients were also significantly less likely to be admitted than NHW patients with the same triage acuity (OR 0.86, 95\\% CI 0.80-0.93). Demographic disparities were particularly acute wherever patients had normal vital signs, public insurance, moderate socio-economic deprivation, or a home address distant from the hospital. An ML model assigned higher importance to triage score for NHB than NHW patients when predicting admission, reflecting these disparities in assignment. We conclude that many visit characteristics, clinical and otherwise, may influence the operation of subconscious biases and affect ML-driven decision support tools."}
{"title":"Multimodal Foundation Models for Early Disease Detection","abstract":"Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health records (EHR), medical imaging, genetics, and ongoing monitoring from wearable devices. Traditional diagnostic models frequently analyze these sources in isolation, which constrains their capacity to identify cross-modal correlations essential for early disease diagnosis. Our research presents a multimodal foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early detection tasks. The framework includes data governance and model management tools in addition to technological performance to improve transparency, reliability, and clinical interpretability. The suggested method works toward a single foundation model for precision diagnostics, which could improve the accuracy of predictions and help doctors make decisions."}
{"title":"Retrieval-Augmented Framework for LLM-Based Clinical Decision Support","abstract":"The increasing complexity of clinical decision-making, alongside the rapid expansion of electronic health records (EHR), presents both opportunities and challenges for delivering data-informed care. This paper proposes a clinical decision support system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist prescribing clinicians. The system generates therapeutic suggestions by analyzing historical EHR data, including patient demographics, presenting complaints, clinical symptoms, diagnostic information, and treatment histories. The framework integrates natural language processing with structured clinical inputs to produce contextually relevant recommendations. Rather than replacing clinician judgment, it is designed to augment decision-making by retrieving and synthesizing precedent cases with comparable characteristics, drawing on local datasets or federated sources where applicable. At its core, the system employs a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline that harmonizes unstructured narratives and codified data to support LLM-based inference. We outline the system's technical components, including representation representation alignment and generation strategies. Preliminary evaluations, conducted with de-identified and synthetic clinical datasets, examine the clinical plausibility and consistency of the model's outputs. Early findings suggest that LLM-based tools may provide valuable decision support in prescribing workflows when appropriately constrained and rigorously validated. This work represents an initial step toward integration of generative AI into real-world clinical decision-making with an emphasis on transparency, safety, and alignment with established practices."}
{"title":"Automated Evaluation can Distinguish the Good and Bad AI Responses to Patient Questions about Hospitalization","abstract":"Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2) appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics, automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI systems and support patient-clinician communication."}
{"title":"A Field Guide to Deploying AI Agents in Clinical Practice","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) integrated into agent-driven workflows hold immense promise for healthcare, yet a significant gap exists between their potential and practical implementation within clinical settings. To address this, we present a practitioner-oriented field manual for deploying generative agents that use electronic health record (EHR) data. This guide is informed by our experience deploying the \"irAE-Agent\", an automated system to detect immune-related adverse events from clinical notes at Mass General Brigham, and by structured interviews with 21 clinicians, engineers, and informatics leaders involved in the project. Our analysis reveals a critical misalignment in clinical AI development: less than 20% of our effort was dedicated to prompt engineering and model development, while over 80% was consumed by the sociotechnical work of implementation. We distill this effort into five \"heavy lifts\": data integration, model validation, ensuring economic value, managing system drift, and governance. By providing actionable solutions for each of these challenges, this field manual shifts the focus from algorithmic development to the essential infrastructure and implementation work required to bridge the \"valley of death\" and successfully translate generative AI from pilot projects into routine clinical care."}
{"title":"Building the EHR Foundation Model via Next Event Prediction","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich temporal dynamics that conventional encoding approaches fail to adequately capture. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for EHR modeling, they struggle to reason about sequential clinical events and temporal dependencies. We propose Next Event Prediction (NEP), a framework that enhances LLMs' temporal reasoning through autoregressive fine-tuning on clinical event sequences. By reformulating EHRs as timestamped event chains and predicting future medical events, NEP explicitly models disease progression patterns and causal relationships. Extensive evaluations across oncology survival prediction and clinical diagnosis tasks demonstrate NEP's superiority, outperforming specialized EHR models by 4.6% AUROC and general-purpose LLMs by 7.2% C-index in temporal reasoning tasks. Our analyses reveal dual benefits: state-of-the-art prediction accuracy combined with clinically interpretable attention patterns that align with known disease pathways."}
{"title":"HyMaTE: A Hybrid Mamba and Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning","abstract":"Electronic health Records (EHRs) have become a cornerstone in modern-day healthcare. They are a crucial part for analyzing the progression of patient health; however, their complexity, characterized by long, multivariate sequences, sparsity, and missing values poses significant challenges in traditional deep learning modeling. While Transformer-based models have demonstrated success in modeling EHR data and predicting clinical outcomes, their quadratic computational complexity and limited context length hinder their efficiency and practical applications. On the other hand, State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba present a promising alternative offering linear-time sequence modeling and improved efficiency for handling long sequences, but focus mostly on mixing sequence-level information rather than channel-level data. To overcome these challenges, we propose HyMaTE (A Hybrid Mamba and Transformer Model for EHR Representation Learning), a novel hybrid model tailored for representing longitudinal data, combining the strengths of SSMs with advanced attention mechanisms. By testing the model on predictive tasks on multiple clinical datasets, we demonstrate HyMaTE's ability to capture an effective, richer, and more nuanced unified representation of EHR data. Additionally, the interpretability of the outcomes achieved by self-attention illustrates the effectiveness of our model as a scalable and generalizable solution for real-world healthcare applications.

{"title":"From Conversation to Query Execution: Benchmarking User and Tool Interactions for EHR Database Agents","abstract":"Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows: Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and 60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to guide future agent development."}
{"title":"Beyond the Clinic: A Large-Scale Evaluation of Augmenting EHR with Wearable Data for Diverse Health Prediction","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a powerful basis for predicting the onset of health outcomes. Yet EHRs primarily capture in-clinic events and miss aspects of daily behavior and lifestyle containing rich health information. Consumer wearables, by contrast, continuously measure activity, heart rate, and sleep, and more, offering complementary signals that can fill this gap. Despite this potential, there has been little systematic evaluation of the benefit that wearable data can bring to health outcome prediction on top of EHRs. In this study, we present an extensible framework for multimodal health outcome prediction that integrates EHR and wearable data streams. Using data from the All of Us Program, we systematically compared the combination of different encoding methods on EHR and wearable data, including the traditional feature engineering approach, as well as foundation model embeddings. Across ten clinical outcomes, wearable integration consistently improved model performance relative to EHR-only baselines, e.g., average delta AUROC +6.8% for major depressive disorder, +9.7% for hypertension, and +12.6% for diabetes. On average across all ten outcomes, fusing EHRs with wearable features shows 8.5% improvement in AUROC. To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale evaluation of wearable-EHR fusion, underscoring the utility of wearable-derived signals in complementing EHRs and enabling more holistic, personalized health outcome predictions. Meanwhile, our analysis elucidates future directions for optimizing foundation models for wearable data and its integration with EHR data."}
{"title":"Optimizing Long-Form Clinical Text Generation with Claim-Based Rewards","abstract":"Automating clinical documentation with large language models requires precise alignment with priorities such as completeness and factual grounding. We present an evaluation-integrated reinforcement learning framework for long-form clinical text generation that couples Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with DocLens, a claim-level evaluator that provides deterministic, dialogue-grounded rewards. Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity, with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or billing preferences."}
{"title":"Beyond Classification Accuracy: Neural-MedBench and the Need for Deeper Reasoning Benchmarks","abstract":"Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation. To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at https:\/\/neuromedbench.github.io\/ as an open and extensible diagnostic testbed, which guides the expansion of future benchmarks and enables rigorous yet cost-effective assessment of clinically trustworthy AI."}
{"title":"Mind the Missing: Variable-Aware Representation Learning for Irregular EHR Time Series using Large Language Models","abstract":"Irregular sampling and high missingness are intrinsic challenges in modeling time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs),where clinical variables are measured at uneven intervals depending on workflow and intervention timing. To address this, we propose VITAL, a variable-aware, large language model (LLM) based framework tailored for learning from irregularly sampled physiological time series. VITAL differentiates between two distinct types of clinical variables: vital signs, which are frequently recorded and exhibit temporal patterns, and laboratory tests, which are measured sporadically and lack temporal structure. It reprograms vital signs into the language space, enabling the LLM to capture temporal context and reason over missing values through explicit encoding. In contrast, laboratory variables are embedded either using representative summary values or a learnable [Not measured] token, depending on their availability. Extensive evaluations on the benchmark datasets from the PhysioNet demonstrate that VITAL outperforms state of the art methods designed for irregular time series. Furthermore, it maintains robust performance under high levels of missingness, which is prevalent in real world clinical scenarios where key variables are often unavailable."}
{"title":"Why Chain of Thought Fails in Clinical Text Understanding","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to clinical care, a domain where both accuracy and transparent reasoning are critical for safe and trustworthy deployment. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits step-by-step reasoning, has demonstrated improvements in performance and interpretability across a wide range of tasks. However, its effectiveness in clinical contexts remains largely unexplored, particularly in the context of electronic health records (EHRs), the primary source of clinical documentation, which are often lengthy, fragmented, and noisy. In this work, we present the first large-scale systematic study of CoT for clinical text understanding. We assess 95 advanced LLMs on 87 real-world clinical text tasks, covering 9 languages and 8 task types. Contrary to prior findings in other domains, we observe that 86.3\\% of models suffer consistent performance degradation in the CoT setting. More capable models remain relatively robust, while weaker ones suffer substantial declines. To better characterize these effects, we perform fine-grained analyses of reasoning length, medical concept alignment, and error profiles, leveraging both LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and clinical expert evaluation. Our results uncover systematic patterns in when and why CoT fails in clinical contexts, which highlight a critical paradox: CoT enhances interpretability but may undermine reliability in clinical text tasks. This work provides an empirical basis for clinical reasoning strategies of LLMs, highlighting the need for transparent and trustworthy approaches."}
{"title":"Federated Markov Imputation: Privacy-Preserving Temporal Imputation in Multi-Centric ICU Environments","abstract":"Missing data is a persistent challenge in federated learning on electronic health records, particularly when institutions collect time-series data at varying temporal granularities. To address this, we propose Federated Markov Imputation (FMI), a privacy-preserving method that enables Intensive Care Units (ICUs) to collaboratively build global transition models for temporal imputation. We evaluate FMI on a real-world sepsis onset prediction task using the MIMIC-IV dataset and show that it outperforms local imputation baselines, especially in scenarios with irregular sampling intervals across ICUs."}
{"title":"Incorporating External Controls for Estimating the Average Treatment Effect on the Treated with High-Dimensional Data: Retaining Double Robustness and Ensuring Double Safety","abstract":"Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are widely regarded as the gold standard for causal inference in biomedical research. For instance, when estimating the average treatment effect on the treated (ATT), a doubly robust estimation procedure can be applied, requiring either the propensity score model or the control outcome model to be correctly specified. In this paper, we address scenarios where external control data, often with a much larger sample size, are available. Such data are typically easier to obtain from historical records or third-party sources. However, we find that incorporating external controls into the standard doubly robust estimator for ATT may paradoxically result in reduced efficiency compared to using the estimator without external controls. This counterintuitive outcome suggests that the naive incorporation of external controls could be detrimental to estimation efficiency. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel doubly robust estimator that guarantees higher efficiency than the standard approach without external controls, even under model misspecification. When all models are correctly specified, this estimator aligns with the standard doubly robust estimator that incorporates external controls and achieves semiparametric efficiency. The asymptotic theory developed in this work applies to high-dimensional confounder settings, which are increasingly common with the growing prevalence of electronic health record data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through extensive simulation studies and a real-world data application."}
{"title":"Towards Self-Supervised Foundation Models for Critical Care Time Series","abstract":"Domain-specific foundation models for healthcare have expanded rapidly in recent years, yet foundation models for critical care time series remain relatively underexplored due to the limited size and availability of datasets. In this work, we introduce an early-stage pre-trained foundation model for critical care time-series based on the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), trained on pooled electronic health record datasets. We demonstrate effective transfer learning by fine-tuning the model on a dataset distinct from the training sources for mortality prediction, where it outperforms supervised baselines, particularly for small datasets ($<5,000$). These contributions highlight the potential of self-supervised foundation models for critical care times series to support generalizable and robust clinical applications in resource-limited settings."}
{"title":"Feasibility of Structuring Stress Documentation Using an Ontology-Guided Large Language Model","abstract":"Stress, arising from the dynamic interaction between external stressors, individual appraisals, and physiological or psychological responses, significantly impacts health yet is often underreported and inconsistently documented, typically captured as unstructured free-text in electronic health records. Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream clinical utility.\n  This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology (MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert validation.\n  Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21 (9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although 24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology.\n  This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI systems. Future work should involve clinical dialogue data and comparison across LLMs."}
{"title":"Revisiting Performance Claims for Chest X-Ray Models Using Clinical Context","abstract":"Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a ``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs. Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis, using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models."}
{"title":"Systematic Comparative Analysis of Large Pretrained Language Models on Contextualized Medication Event Extraction","abstract":"Attention-based models have become the leading approach in modeling medical language for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in clinical notes. These models outperform traditional techniques by effectively capturing contextual representations of language. In this research a comparative analysis is done amongst pre-trained attention based models namely Bert Base, BioBert, two variations of Bio+Clinical Bert, RoBerta, and Clinical Longformer on task related to Electronic Health Record (EHR) information extraction. The tasks from Track 1 of Harvard Medical School's 2022 National Clinical NLP Challenges (n2c2) are considered for this comparison, with the Contextualized Medication Event Dataset (CMED) given for these task. CMED is a dataset of unstructured EHRs and annotated notes that contain task relevant information about the EHRs. The goal of the challenge is to develop effective solutions for extracting contextual information related to patient medication events from EHRs using data driven methods. Each pre-trained model is fine-tuned and applied on CMED to perform medication extraction, medical event detection, and multi-dimensional medication event context classification. Processing methods are also detailed for breaking down EHRs for compatibility with the applied models. Performance analysis has been carried out using a script based on constructing medical terms from the evaluation portion of CMED with metrics including recall, precision, and F1-Score. The results demonstrate that models pre-trained on clinical data are more effective in detecting medication and medication events, but Bert Base, pre-trained on general domain data showed to be the most effective for classifying the context of events related to medications."}
{"title":"Causal Representation Learning from Multimodal Clinical Records under Non-Random Modality Missingness","abstract":"Clinical notes contain rich patient information, such as diagnoses or medications, making them valuable for patient representation learning. Recent advances in large language models have further improved the ability to extract meaningful representations from clinical texts. However, clinical notes are often missing. For example, in our analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, 24.5% of patients have no available discharge summaries. In such cases, representations can be learned from other modalities such as structured data, chest X-rays, or radiology reports. Yet the availability of these modalities is influenced by clinical decision-making and varies across patients, resulting in modality missing-not-at-random (MMNAR) patterns. We propose a causal representation learning framework that leverages observed data and informative missingness in multimodal clinical records. It consists of: (1) an MMNAR-aware modality fusion component that integrates structured data, imaging, and text while conditioning on missingness patterns to capture patient health and clinician-driven assignment; (2) a modality reconstruction component with contrastive learning to ensure semantic sufficiency in representation learning; and (3) a multitask outcome prediction model with a rectifier that corrects for residual bias from specific modality observation patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across MIMIC-IV and eICU show consistent gains over the strongest baselines, achieving up to 13.8% AUC improvement for hospital readmission and 13.1% for ICU admission."}
{"title":"Longitudinal and Multimodal Recording System to Capture Real-World Patient-Clinician Conversations for AI and Encounter Research: Protocol","abstract":"The promise of AI in medicine depends on learning from data that reflect what matters to patients and clinicians. Most existing models are trained on electronic health records (EHRs), which capture biological measures but rarely patient-clinician interactions. These relationships, central to care, unfold across voice, text, and video, yet remain absent from datasets. As a result, AI systems trained solely on EHRs risk perpetuating a narrow biomedical view of medicine and overlooking the lived exchanges that define clinical encounters. Our objective is to design, implement, and evaluate the feasibility of a longitudinal, multimodal system for capturing patient-clinician encounters, linking 360 degree video\/audio recordings with surveys and EHR data to create a dataset for AI research. This single site study is in an academic outpatient endocrinology clinic at Mayo Clinic. Adult patients with in-person visits to participating clinicians are invited to enroll. Encounters are recorded with a 360 degree video camera. After each visit, patients complete a survey on empathy, satisfaction, pace, and treatment burden. Demographic and clinical data are extracted from the EHR. Feasibility is assessed using five endpoints: clinician consent, patient consent, recording success, survey completion, and data linkage across modalities. Recruitment began in January 2025. By August 2025, 35 of 36 eligible clinicians (97%) and 212 of 281 approached patients (75%) had consented. Of consented encounters, 162 (76%) had complete recordings and 204 (96%) completed the survey. This study aims to demonstrate the feasibility of a replicable framework for capturing the multimodal dynamics of patient-clinician encounters. By detailing workflows, endpoints, and ethical safeguards, it provides a template for longitudinal datasets and lays the foundation for AI models that incorporate the complexity of care."}
{"title":"EHR-MCP: Real-world Evaluation of Clinical Information Retrieval by Large Language Models via Model Context Protocol","abstract":"Background: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in medicine, but their deployment in hospitals is limited by restricted access to electronic health record (EHR) systems. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration between LLMs and external tools.\n  Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP can autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital setting.\n  Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated with the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct agent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the infection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were retrospectively analyzed. Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was measured.\n  Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools. Except for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy. Performance was lower in the complex task requiring time-dependent calculations. Most errors arose from incorrect arguments or misinterpretation of tool results. Responses from EHR-MCP were reliable, though long and repetitive data risked exceeding the context window.\n  Conclusions: LLMs can retrieve clinical data from an EHR via MCP tools in a real hospital setting, achieving near-perfect performance in simple tasks while highlighting challenges in complex ones. EHR-MCP provides an infrastructure for secure, consistent data access and may serve as a foundation for hospital AI agents. Future work should extend beyond retrieval to reasoning, generation, and clinical impact assessment, paving the way for effective integration of generative AI into clinical practice."}
{"title":"Clinical Multi-modal Fusion with Heterogeneous Graph and Disease Correlation Learning for Multi-Disease Prediction","abstract":"Multi-disease diagnosis using multi-modal data like electronic health records and medical imaging is a critical clinical task. Although existing deep learning methods have achieved initial success in this area, a significant gap persists for their real-world application. This gap arises because they often overlook unavoidable practical challenges, such as modality missingness, noise, temporal asynchrony, and evidentiary inconsistency across modalities for different diseases. To overcome these limitations, we propose HGDC-Fuse, a novel framework that constructs a patient-centric multi-modal heterogeneous graph to robustly integrate asynchronous and incomplete multi-modal data. Moreover, we design a heterogeneous graph learning module to aggregate multi-source information, featuring a disease correlation-guided attention layer that resolves the modal inconsistency issue by learning disease-specific modality weights based on disease correlations. On the large-scale MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets, HGDC-Fuse significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."}
{"title":"Self-supervised learning of imaging and clinical signatures using a multimodal joint-embedding predictive architecture","abstract":"The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges. We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC), but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC). We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis."}
{"title":"Time-smoothed inverse probability weighted estimation of effects of generalized time-varying treatment strategies on repeated outcomes truncated by death","abstract":"Researchers are often interested in estimating effects of generalized time-varying treatment strategies on the mean of an outcome at one or more selected follow-up times of interest. For example, the Medications and Weight Gain in PCORnet (MedWeight) study aimed to estimate effects of adhering to flexible medication regimes on future weight change using electronic health records (EHR) data. This problem presents several methodological challenges that have not been jointly addressed in the prior literature. First, this setting involves treatment strategies that vary over time and depend dynamically and non-deterministically on measured confounder history. Second, the outcome is repeatedly, non-monotonically, informatively, and sparsely measured in the data source. Third, some individuals die during follow-up, rendering the outcome of interest undefined at the follow-up time of interest. In this article, we pose a range of inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators targeting effects of generalized time-varying treatment strategies in truncation by death settings that allow time-smoothing for precision gain. We conducted simulation studies that confirm precision gains of the time-smoothed IPW approaches over more conventional IPW approaches that do not leverage the repeated outcome measurements. We illustrate an application of the IPW approaches to estimate comparative effects of adhering to flexible antidepressant medication strategies on future weight change. The methods are implemented in the accompanying R package, smoothedIPW."}
{"title":"Integrating Text and Time-Series into (Large) Language Models to Predict Medical Outcomes","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) excel at text generation, but their ability to handle clinical classification tasks involving structured data, such as time series, remains underexplored.

This study is among the first to use document embeddings for predicting antibiotic resistance, offering a novel pathway for improving antimicrobial stewardship."}
{"title":"Early Prediction of Multi-Label Care Escalation Triggers in the Intensive Care Unit Using Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients often present with complex, overlapping signs of physiological deterioration that require timely escalation of care. Traditional early warning systems, such as SOFA or MEWS, are limited by their focus on single outcomes and fail to capture the multi-dimensional nature of clinical decline. This study proposes a multi-label classification framework to predict Care Escalation Triggers (CETs), including respiratory failure, hemodynamic instability, renal compromise, and neurological deterioration, using the first 24 hours of ICU data. Using the MIMIC-IV database, CETs are defined through rule-based criteria applied to data from hours 24 to 72 (for example, oxygen saturation below 90, mean arterial pressure below 65 mmHg, creatinine increase greater than 0.3 mg\/dL, or a drop in Glasgow Coma Scale score greater than 2). Features are extracted from the first 24 hours and include vital sign aggregates, laboratory values, and static demographics. We train and evaluate multiple classification models on a cohort of 85,242 ICU stays (80 percent training: 68,193; 20 percent testing: 17,049). Evaluation metrics include per-label precision, recall, F1-score, and Hamming loss. XGBoost, the best performing model, achieves F1-scores of 0.66 for respiratory, 0.72 for hemodynamic, 0.76 for renal, and 0.62 for neurologic deterioration, outperforming baseline models. Feature analysis shows that clinically relevant parameters such as respiratory rate, blood pressure, and creatinine are the most influential predictors, consistent with the clinical definitions of the CETs. The proposed framework demonstrates practical potential for early, interpretable clinical alerts without requiring complex time-series modeling or natural language processing."}
{"title":"MedicalOS: An LLM Agent based Operating System for Digital Healthcare","abstract":"Decades' advances in digital health technologies, such as electronic health records, have largely streamlined routine clinical processes. Yet, most these systems are still hard to learn and use: Clinicians often face the burden of managing multiple tools, repeating manual actions for each patient, navigating complicated UI trees to locate functions, and spending significant time on administration instead of caring for patients. The recent rise of large language model (LLM) based agents demonstrates exceptional capability in coding and computer operation, revealing the potential for humans to interact with operating systems and software not by direct manipulation, but by instructing agents through natural language. This shift highlights the need for an abstraction layer, an agent-computer interface, that translates human language into machine-executable commands. In digital healthcare, however, requires a more domain-specific abstractions that strictly follow trusted clinical guidelines and procedural standards to ensure safety, transparency, and compliance. To address this need, we present \\textbf{MedicalOS}, a unified agent-based operational system designed as such a domain-specific abstract layer for healthcare. It translates human instructions into pre-defined digital healthcare commands, such as patient inquiry, history retrieval, exam management, report generation, referrals, treatment planning, that we wrapped as off-the-shelf tools using machine languages (e.g., Python, APIs, MCP, Linux). We empirically validate MedicalOS on 214 patient cases across 22 specialties, demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy and confidence, clinically sound examination requests, and consistent generation of structured reports and medication recommendations. These results highlight MedicalOS as a trustworthy and scalable foundation for advancing workflow automation in clinical practice."}
{"title":"Term2Note: Synthesising Differentially Private Clinical Notes from Medical Terms","abstract":"Training data is fundamental to the success of modern machine learning models, yet in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, the use of real-world training data is severely constrained by concerns over privacy leakage. A promising solution to this challenge is the use of differentially private (DP) synthetic data, which offers formal privacy guarantees while maintaining data utility. However, striking the right balance between privacy protection and utility remains challenging in clinical note synthesis, given its domain specificity and the complexity of long-form text generation. In this paper, we present Term2Note, a methodology to synthesise long clinical notes under strong DP constraints. By structurally separating content and form, Term2Note generates section-wise note content conditioned on DP medical terms, with each governed by separate DP constraints. A DP quality maximiser further enhances synthetic notes by selecting high-quality outputs. Experimental results show that Term2Note produces synthetic notes with statistical properties closely aligned with real clinical notes, demonstrating strong fidelity. In addition, multi-label classification models trained on these synthetic notes perform comparably to those trained on real data, confirming their high utility. Compared to existing DP text generation baselines, Term2Note achieves substantial improvements in both fidelity and utility while operating under fewer assumptions, suggesting its potential as a viable privacy-preserving alternative to using sensitive clinical notes."}
{"title":"Understanding Expert Exploration in EHR Visualization Tools: The ParcoursVis Use Case","abstract":"We introduce our ongoing work toward an insight-based evaluation methodology aimed at understanding practitioners' mental models when exploring medical data. It is based on ParcoursVis, a Progressive Visual Analytics system designed to visualize event sequences derived from Electronic Health Records at scale (millions of patients, billions of events), developed in collaboration with the Emergency Departments of 16 Parisian hospitals and with the French Social Security. Building on prior usability validation, our current evaluation focuses on the insights generated by expert users and aims to better understand the exploration strategies they employ when engaging with exploration visualization tools. We describe our system and outline our evaluation protocol, analysis strategy, and preliminary findings. Building on this approach and our pilot results, we contribute a design protocol for conducting insight-based studies under real-world constraints, including the availability of health practitioners whom we were fortunate to interview. Our findings highlight a loop, where the use of the system helps refine data variables identification and the system itself. We aim to shed light on generated insights, to highlight the utility of exploratory tools in health data analysis contexts."}
{"title":"Smart Trial: Evaluating the Use of Large Language Models for Recruiting Clinical Trial Participants via Social Media","abstract":"Clinical trials (CT) are essential for advancing medical research and treatment, yet efficiently recruiting eligible participants -- each of whom must meet complex eligibility criteria -- remains a significant challenge. Traditional recruitment approaches, such as advertisements or electronic health record screening within hospitals, are often time-consuming and geographically constrained. This work addresses the recruitment challenge by leveraging the vast amount of health-related information individuals share on social media platforms. With the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) capable of sophisticated text understanding, we pose the central research question: Can LLM-driven tools facilitate CT recruitment by identifying potential participants through their engagement on social media? To investigate this question, we introduce TRIALQA, a novel dataset comprising two social media collections from the subreddits on colon cancer and prostate cancer. Using eligibility criteria from public real-world CTs, experienced annotators are hired to annotate TRIALQA to indicate (1) whether a social media user meets a given eligibility criterion and (2) the user's stated reasons for interest in participating in CT. We benchmark seven widely used LLMs on these two prediction tasks, employing six distinct training and inference strategies. Our extensive experiments reveal that, while LLMs show considerable promise, they still face challenges in performing the complex, multi-hop reasoning needed to accurately assess eligibility criteria."}
{"title":"Signal Fidelity Index-Aware Calibration for Dementia Predictions Across Heterogeneous Real-World Data","abstract":"\\textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay: variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.\n  \\textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets without outcome labels.\n  \\textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency, entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized across 50 simulation batches.\n  \\textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\u03b1$ = 2.0), SFI-aware calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from 10.3\\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\\% for Recall, with notable increases in Precision (31.9\\%) and F1-score (26.1\\%). Performance approached reference standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\\% and Balanced Accuracy and Detection Rate improved by 52.3\\% and 41.1\\%, respectively.\n  \\textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model generalization.

{"title":"A Common Pipeline for Harmonizing Electronic Health Record Data for Translational Research","abstract":"Despite the growing availability of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, researchers often face substantial barriers in effectively using these data for translational research due to their complexity, heterogeneity, and lack of standardized tools and documentation. To address this critical gap, we introduce PEHRT, a common pipeline for harmonizing EHR data for translational research. PEHRT is a comprehensive, ready-to-use resource that includes open-source code, visualization tools, and detailed documentation to streamline the process of preparing EHR data for analysis. The pipeline provides tools to harmonize structured and unstructured EHR data to standardized ontologies to ensure consistency across diverse coding systems. In the presence of unmapped or heterogeneous local codes, PEHRT further leverages representation learning and pre-trained language models to generate robust embeddings that capture semantic relationships across sites to mitigate heterogeneity and enable integrative downstream analyses. PEHRT also supports cross-institutional co-training through shared representations, allowing participating sites to collaboratively refine embeddings and enhance generalizability without sharing individual-level data. The framework is data model-agnostic and can be seamlessly deployed across diverse healthcare systems to produce interoperable, research-ready datasets. By lowering the technical barriers to EHR-based research, PEHRT empowers investigators to transform raw clinical data into reproducible, analysis-ready resources for discovery and innovation."}
{"title":"General Demographic Foundation Models for Enhancing Predictive Performance Across Diseases and Populations","abstract":"Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records. They are the most widespread information across populations and diseases, and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often treated as auxiliaries in model design, with limited attention being paid to learning their representations. This study explored the development of a General Demographic Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational model tailored to demographic attributes, focusing on age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with diverse diseases and populations compositions from different geographic regions. The composition of GDP architecture was explored through examining combinations of ordering approaches and encoding methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into effective latent embeddings. Results demonstrate the feasibility of GDP to generalize across task, diseases, and populations. In detailed composition, the sequential ordering substantially improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification. Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundation models for tabular demographic attributes offer a promising direction for improving predictive performance in healthcare applications."}
{"title":"Automated Hierarchical Graph Construction for Multi-source Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs), comprising diverse clinical data such as diagnoses, medications, and laboratory results, hold great promise for translational research. EHR-derived data have advanced disease prevention, improved clinical trial recruitment, and generated real-world evidence. Synthesizing EHRs across institutions enables large-scale, generalizable studies that capture rare diseases and population diversity, but remains hindered by the heterogeneity of medical codes, institution-specific terminologies, and the absence of standardized data structures. These barriers limit the interpretability, comparability, and scalability of EHR-based analyses, underscoring the need for robust methods to harmonize and extract meaningful insights from distributed, heterogeneous data. To address this, we propose MASH (Multi-source Automated Structured Hierarchy), a fully automated framework that aligns medical codes across institutions using neural optimal transport and constructs hierarchical graphs with learned hyperbolic embeddings. During training, MASH integrates information from pre-trained language models, co-occurrence patterns, textual descriptions, and supervised labels to capture semantic and hierarchical relationships among medical concepts more effectively. Applied to real-world EHR data, including diagnosis, medication, and laboratory codes, MASH produces interpretable hierarchical graphs that facilitate the navigation and understanding of heterogeneous clinical data. Notably, it generates the first automated hierarchies for unstructured local laboratory codes, establishing foundational references for downstream applications."}
{"title":"On the Reproducibility of \"FairCLIP: Harnessing Fairness in Vision-Language Learning''","abstract":"We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al. (2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset. However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification."}

To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are: (1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich, de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache, and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality, generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data, unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments."}
{"title":"Code Like Humans: A Multi-Agent Solution for Medical Coding","abstract":"In medical coding, experts map unstructured clinical notes to alphanumeric codes for diagnoses and procedures. We introduce Code Like Humans: a new agentic framework for medical coding with large language models. It implements official coding guidelines for human experts, and it is the first solution that can support the full ICD-10 coding system (+70K labels). It achieves the best performance to date on rare diagnosis codes (fine-tuned discriminative classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes, to which they are limited). Towards future work, we also contribute an analysis of system performance and identify its `blind spots' (codes that are systematically undercoded)."}
{"title":"Write on Paper, Wrong in Practice: Why LLMs Still Struggle with Writing Clinical Notes","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) are often proposed as tools to streamline clinical documentation, a task viewed as both high-volume and low-risk. However, even seemingly straightforward applications of LLMs raise complex sociotechnical considerations to translate into practice. This case study, conducted at KidsAbility, a pediatric rehabilitation facility in Ontario, Canada examined the use of LLMs to support occupational therapists in reducing documentation burden.We conducted a qualitative study involving 20 clinicians who participated in pilot programs using two AI technologies: a general-purpose proprietary LLM and a bespoke model fine-tuned on proprietary historical documentation.\n  Our findings reveal that documentation challenges are sociotechnical in nature, shaped by clinical workflows, organizational policies, and system constraints. Four key themes emerged: (1) the heterogeneity of workflows, (2) the documentation burden is systemic and not directly linked to the creation of any single type of documentation, (3) the need for flexible tools and clinician autonomy, and (4) effective implementation requires mutual learning between clinicians and AI systems.\n  While LLMs show promise in easing documentation tasks, their success will depend on flexible, adaptive integration that supports clinician autonomy. Beyond technical performance, sustained adoption will require training programs and implementation strategies that reflect the complexity of clinical environments."}
{"title":"Semantic Analysis of SNOMED CT Concept Co-occurrences in Clinical Documentation using MIMIC-IV","abstract":"Clinical notes contain rich clinical narratives but their unstructured format poses challenges for large-scale analysis. Standardized terminologies such as SNOMED CT improve interoperability, yet understanding how concepts relate through co-occurrence and semantic similarity remains underexplored. In this study, we leverage the MIMIC-IV database to investigate the relationship between SNOMED CT concept co-occurrence patterns and embedding-based semantic similarity. Using Normalized Pointwise Mutual Information (NPMI) and pretrained embeddings (e.g., ClinicalBERT, BioBERT), we examine whether frequently co-occurring concepts are also semantically close, whether embeddings can suggest missing concepts, and how these relationships evolve temporally and across specialties. Our analyses reveal that while co-occurrence and semantic similarity are weakly correlated, embeddings capture clinically meaningful associations not always reflected in documentation frequency. Embedding-based suggestions frequently matched concepts later documented, supporting their utility for augmenting clinical annotations. Clustering of concept embeddings yielded coherent clinical themes (symptoms, labs, diagnoses, cardiovascular conditions) that map to patient phenotypes and care patterns. Finally, co-occurrence patterns linked to outcomes such as mortality and readmission demonstrate the practical utility of this approach. Collectively, our findings highlight the complementary value of co-occurrence statistics and semantic embeddings in improving documentation completeness, uncovering latent clinical relationships, and informing decision support and phenotyping applications."}
{"title":"CEHR-XGPT: A Scalable Multi-Task Foundation Model for Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) provide a rich, longitudinal view of patient health and hold significant potential for advancing clinical decision support, risk prediction, and data-driven healthcare research. However, most artificial intelligence (AI) models for EHRs are designed for narrow, single-purpose tasks, limiting their generalizability and utility in real-world settings. Here, we present CEHR-XGPT, a general-purpose foundation model for EHR data that unifies three essential capabilities - feature representation, zero-shot prediction, and synthetic data generation - within a single architecture. To support temporal reasoning over clinical sequences, CEHR-XGPT incorporates a novel time-token-based learning framework that explicitly encodes patients' dynamic timelines into the model structure. CEHR-XGPT demonstrates strong performance across all three tasks and generalizes effectively to external datasets through vocabulary expansion and fine-tuning. Its versatility enables rapid model development, cohort discovery, and patient outcome forecasting without the need for task-specific retraining."}
{"title":"Extracting OPQRST in Electronic Health Records using Large Language Models with Reasoning","abstract":"The extraction of critical patient information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) poses significant challenges due to the complexity and unstructured nature of the data. Traditional machine learning approaches often fail to capture pertinent details efficiently, making it difficult for clinicians to utilize these tools effectively in patient care. This paper introduces a novel approach to extracting the OPQRST assessment from EHRs by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose to reframe the task from sequence labeling to text generation, enabling the models to provide reasoning steps that mimic a physician's cognitive processes. This approach enhances interpretability and adapts to the limited availability of labeled data in healthcare settings. Furthermore, we address the challenge of evaluating the accuracy of machine-generated text in clinical contexts by proposing a modification to traditional Named Entity Recognition (NER) metrics. This includes the integration of semantic similarity measures, such as the BERT Score, to assess the alignment between generated text and the clinical intent of the original records. Our contributions demonstrate a significant advancement in the use of AI in healthcare, offering a scalable solution that improves the accuracy and usability of information extraction from EHRs, thereby aiding clinicians in making more informed decisions and enhancing patient care outcomes."}
{"title":"A Multi-target Bayesian Transformer Framework for Predicting Cardiovascular Disease Biomarkers during Pandemics","abstract":"The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted healthcare systems worldwide, disproportionately impacting individuals with chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). These disruptions -- through delayed care and behavioral changes, affected key CVD biomarkers, including LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), HbA1c, BMI, and systolic blood pressure (SysBP). Accurate modeling of these changes is crucial for predicting disease progression and guiding preventive care. However, prior work has not addressed multi-target prediction of CVD biomarker from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) using machine learning (ML), while jointly capturing biomarker interdependencies, temporal patterns, and predictive uncertainty. In this paper, we propose MBT-CB, a Multi-target Bayesian Transformer (MBT) with pre-trained BERT-based transformer framework to jointly predict LDL-C, HbA1c, BMI and SysBP CVD biomarkers from EHR data. The model leverages Bayesian Variational Inference to estimate uncertainties, embeddings to capture temporal relationships and a DeepMTR model to capture biomarker inter-relationships. We evaluate MBT-CT on retrospective EHR data from 3,390 CVD patient records (304 unique patients) in Central Massachusetts during the Covid-19 pandemic. MBT-CB outperformed a comprehensive set of baselines including other BERT-based ML models, achieving an MAE of 0.00887, RMSE of 0.0135 and MSE of 0.00027, while effectively capturing data and model uncertainty, patient biomarker inter-relationships, and temporal dynamics via its attention and embedding mechanisms. MBT-CB's superior performance highlights its potential to improve CVD biomarker prediction and support clinical decision-making during pandemics."}
{"title":"A Narrative-Driven Computational Framework for Clinician Burnout Surveillance","abstract":"Clinician burnout poses a substantial threat to patient safety, particularly in high-acuity intensive care units (ICUs). Existing research predominantly relies on retrospective survey tools or broad electronic health record (EHR) metadata, often overlooking the valuable narrative information embedded in clinical notes. In this study, we analyze 10,000 ICU discharge summaries from MIMIC-IV, a publicly available database derived from the electronic health records of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. The dataset encompasses diverse patient data, including vital signs, medical orders, diagnoses, procedures, treatments, and deidentified free-text clinical notes. We introduce a hybrid pipeline that combines BioBERT sentiment embeddings fine-tuned for clinical narratives, a lexical stress lexicon tailored for clinician burnout surveillance, and five-topic latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with workload proxies. A provider-level logistic regression classifier achieves a precision of 0.80, a recall of 0.89, and an F1 score of 0.84 on a stratified hold-out set, surpassing metadata-only baselines by greater than or equal to 0.17 F1 score. Specialty-specific analysis indicates elevated burnout risk among providers in Radiology, Psychiatry, and Neurology. Our findings demonstrate that ICU clinical narratives contain actionable signals for proactive well-being monitoring."}
{"title":"ASCENDgpt: A Phenotype-Aware Transformer Model for Cardiovascular Risk Prediction from Electronic Health Records","abstract":"We present ASCENDgpt, a transformer-based model specifically designed for cardiovascular risk prediction from longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach introduces a novel phenotype-aware tokenization scheme that maps 47,155 raw ICD codes to 176 clinically meaningful phenotype tokens, achieving 99.6\\% consolidation of diagnosis codes while preserving semantic information. This phenotype mapping contributes to a total vocabulary of 10,442 tokens - a 77.9\\% reduction when compared with using raw ICD codes directly. We pretrain ASCENDgpt on sequences derived from 19402 unique individuals using a masked language modeling objective, then fine-tune for time-to-event prediction of five cardiovascular outcomes: myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), cardiovascular death, and all-cause mortality. Our model achieves excellent discrimination on the held-out test set with an average C-index of 0.816, demonstrating strong performance across all outcomes (MI: 0.792, stroke: 0.824, MACE: 0.800, cardiovascular death: 0.842, all-cause mortality: 0.824). The phenotype-based approach enables clinically interpretable predictions while maintaining computational efficiency. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain-specific tokenization and pretraining for EHR-based risk prediction tasks."}
{"title":"MoE-Health: A Mixture of Experts Framework for Robust Multimodal Healthcare Prediction","abstract":"Healthcare systems generate diverse multimodal data, including Electronic Health Records (EHR), clinical notes, and medical images. Effectively leveraging this data for clinical prediction is challenging, particularly as real-world samples often present with varied or incomplete modalities. Existing approaches typically require complete modality data or rely on manual selection strategies, limiting their applicability in real-world clinical settings where data availability varies across patients and institutions. To address these limitations, we propose MoE-Health, a novel Mixture of Experts framework designed for robust multimodal fusion in healthcare prediction. MoE-Health architecture is specifically developed to handle samples with differing modalities and improve performance on critical clinical tasks. By leveraging specialized expert networks and a dynamic gating mechanism, our approach dynamically selects and combines relevant experts based on available data modalities, enabling flexible adaptation to varying data availability scenarios. We evaluate MoE-Health on the MIMIC-IV dataset across three critical clinical prediction tasks: in-hospital mortality prediction, long length of stay, and hospital readmission prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that MoE-Health achieves superior performance compared to existing multimodal fusion methods while maintaining robustness across different modality availability patterns. The framework effectively integrates multimodal information, offering improved predictive performance and robustness in handling heterogeneous and incomplete healthcare data, making it particularly suitable for deployment in diverse healthcare environments with heterogeneous data availability."}
{"title":"Multi-Ontology Integration with Dual-Axis Propagation for Medical Concept Representation","abstract":"Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships, overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction."}
{"title":"Structure-aware Hypergraph Transformer for Diagnosis Prediction in Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR. However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction."}
{"title":"Beyond Prediction: Reinforcement Learning as the Defining Leap in Healthcare AI","abstract":"Reinforcement learning (RL) marks a fundamental shift in how artificial intelligence is applied in healthcare. Instead of merely predicting outcomes, RL actively decides interventions with long term goals. Unlike traditional models that operate on fixed associations, RL systems learn through trial, feedback, and long-term reward optimization, introducing transformative possibilities and new risks. From an information fusion lens, healthcare RL typically integrates multi-source signals such as vitals, labs clinical notes, imaging and device telemetry using temporal and decision-level mechanisms. These systems can operate within centralized, federated, or edge architectures to meet real-time clinical constraints, and naturally span data, features and decision fusion levels. This survey explore RL's rise in healthcare as more than a set of tools, rather a shift toward agentive intelligence in clinical environments. We first structure the landscape of RL techniques including model-based and model-free methods, offline and batch-constrained approaches, and emerging strategies for reward specification and uncertainty calibration through the lens of healthcare constraints. We then comprehensively analyze RL applications spanning critical care, chronic disease, mental health, diagnostics, and robotic assistance, identifying their trends, gaps, and translational bottlenecks. In contrast to prior reviews, we critically analyze RL's ethical, deployment, and reward design challenges, and synthesize lessons for safe, human-aligned policy learning. This paper serves as both a a technical roadmap and a critical reflection of RL's emerging transformative role in healthcare AI not as prediction machinery, but as agentive clinical intelligence."}
{"title":"Prediction of mortality and resource utilization in critical care: a deep learning approach using multimodal electronic health records with natural language processing techniques","abstract":"Background Predicting mortality and resource utilization from electronic health records (EHRs) is challenging yet crucial for optimizing patient outcomes and managing costs in intensive care unit (ICU). Existing approaches predominantly focus on structured EHRs, often ignoring the valuable clinical insights in free-text notes. Additionally, the potential of textual information within structured data is not fully leveraged. This study aimed to introduce and assess a deep learning framework using natural language processing techniques that integrates multimodal EHRs to predict mortality and resource utilization in critical care settings. Methods Utilizing two real-world EHR datasets, we developed and evaluated our model on three clinical tasks with leading existing methods. We also performed an ablation study on three key components in our framework: medical prompts, free-texts, and pre-trained sentence encoder. Furthermore, we assessed the model's robustness against the corruption in structured EHRs. Results Our experiments on two real-world datasets across three clinical tasks showed that our proposed model improved performance metrics by 1.6\\%\/0.8\\% on BACC\/AUROC for mortality prediction, 0.5%\/2.2% on RMSE\/MAE for LOS prediction, 10.9%\/11.0% on RMSE\/MAE for surgical duration estimation compared to the best existing methods. It consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to other baselines across three tasks at different corruption rates. Conclusions The proposed framework is an effective and accurate deep learning approach for predicting mortality and resource utilization in critical care. The study also highlights the success of using prompt learning with a transformer encoder in analyzing multimodal EHRs. Importantly, the model showed strong resilience to data corruption within structured data, especially at high corruption levels."}
{"title":"Latent Factor Point Processes for Patient Representation in Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHR) contain valuable longitudinal patient-level information, yet most statistical methods reduce the irregular timing of EHR codes into simple counts, thereby discarding rich temporal structure. Existing temporal models often impose restrictive parametric assumptions or are tailored to code level rather than patient-level tasks. We propose the latent factor point process model, which represents code occurrences as a high-dimensional point process whose conditional intensity is driven by a low dimensional latent Poisson process. This low-rank structure reflects the clinical reality that thousands of codes are governed by a small number of underlying disease processes, while enabling statistically efficient estimation in high dimensions. Building on this model, we introduce the Fourier-Eigen embedding, a patient representation constructed from the spectral density matrix of the observed process. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that these embeddings efficiently capture subgroup-specific temporal patterns for downstream classification and clustering. Simulations and an application to an Alzheimer's disease EHR cohort demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach in uncovering clinically meaningful heterogeneity."}
{"title":"PRISM: A Framework Harnessing Unsupervised Visual Representations and Textual Prompts for Explainable MACE Survival Prediction from Cardiac Cine MRI","abstract":"Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) remains a central challenge in cardiovascular prognosis. We present PRISM (Prompt-guided Representation Integration for Survival Modeling), a self-supervised framework that integrates visual representations from non-contrast cardiac cine magnetic resonance imaging with structured electronic health records (EHRs) for survival analysis. PRISM extracts temporally synchronized imaging features through motion-aware multi-view distillation and modulates them using medically informed textual prompts to enable fine-grained risk prediction. Across four independent clinical cohorts, PRISM consistently surpasses classical survival prediction models and state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning baselines under internal and external validation. Further clinical findings demonstrate that the combined imaging and EHR representations derived from PRISM provide valuable insights into cardiac risk across diverse cohorts. Three distinct imaging signatures associated with elevated MACE risk are uncovered, including lateral wall dyssynchrony, inferior wall hypersensitivity, and anterior elevated focus during diastole. Prompt-guided attribution further identifies hypertension, diabetes, and smoking as dominant contributors among clinical and physiological EHR factors."}
{"title":"Mitigating Clinician Information Overload: Generative AI for Integrated EHR and RPM Data Analysis","abstract":"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), offer powerful capabilities for interpreting the complex data landscape in healthcare. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the capabilities, requirements and applications of GenAI for deriving clinical insights and improving clinical efficiency. We first provide some background on the forms and sources of patient data, namely real-time Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM) streams and traditional Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The sheer volume and heterogeneity of this combined data present significant challenges to clinicians and contribute to information overload. In addition, we explore the potential of LLM-powered applications for improving clinical efficiency. These applications can enhance navigation of longitudinal patient data and provide actionable clinical decision support through natural language dialogue. We discuss the opportunities this presents for streamlining clinician workflows and personalizing care, alongside critical challenges such as data integration complexity, ensuring data quality and RPM data reliability, maintaining patient privacy, validating AI outputs for clinical safety, mitigating bias, and ensuring clinical acceptance. We believe this work represents the first summarization of GenAI techniques for managing clinician data overload due to combined RPM \/ EHR data complexities."}
{"title":"Proactive HIV Care: AI-Based Comorbidity Prediction from Routine EHR Data","abstract":"People living with HIV face a high burden of comorbidities, yet early detection is often limited by symptom-driven screening. We evaluate the potential of AI to predict multiple comorbidities from routinely collected Electronic Health Records. Using data from 2,200 HIV-positive patients in South East London, comprising 30 laboratory markers and 7 demographic\/social attributes, we compare demographic-aware models (which use both laboratory\/social variables and demographic information as input) against demographic-unaware models (which exclude all demographic information). Across all methods, demographic-aware models consistently outperformed unaware counterparts. Demographic recoverability experiments revealed that gender and age can be accurately inferred from laboratory data, underscoring both the predictive value and fairness considerations of demographic features. These findings show that combining demographic and laboratory data can improve automated, multi-label comorbidity prediction in HIV care, while raising important questions about bias and interpretability in clinical AI."}
{"title":"Trustworthy Agents for Electronic Health Records through Confidence Estimation","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) show promise for extracting information from Electronic Health Records (EHR) and supporting clinical decisions. However, deployment in clinical settings faces challenges due to hallucination risks. We propose Hallucination Controlled Accuracy at k% (HCAcc@k%), a novel metric quantifying the accuracy-reliability trade-off at varying confidence thresholds. We introduce TrustEHRAgent, a confidence-aware agent incorporating stepwise confidence estimation for clinical question answering. Experiments on MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare AI agents. Our work contributes to developing trustworthy clinical agents that deliver accurate information or transparently express uncertainty when confidence is low."}
{"title":"End to End Autoencoder MLP Framework for Sepsis Prediction","abstract":"Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent, respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness, generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across heterogeneous ICU environments."}
{"title":"A New NMT Model for Translating Clinical Texts from English to Spanish","abstract":"Translating electronic health record (EHR) narratives from English to Spanish is a clinically important yet challenging task due to the lack of a parallel-aligned corpus and the abundant unknown words contained.

NOOV integrates a bilingual lexicon automatically learned from parallel-aligned corpora and a phrase look-up table extracted from a large biomedical knowledge resource, to alleviate both the unknown word problem and the word-repeat challenge in NMT, enhancing better phrase generation of NMT systems. Evaluation shows that NOOV is able to generate better translation of EHR with improvement in both accuracy and fluency."}
{"title":"Estimating the average treatment effect in cluster-randomized trials with misclassified outcomes and non-random validation subsets","abstract":"Randomized trials are viewed as the benchmark for assessing causal effects of treatments on outcomes of interest. Nonetheless, challenges such as measurement error can undermine the standard causal assumptions for randomized trials. In ASPIRE, a cluster-randomized trial, pediatric primary care clinics were assigned to one of two treatments aimed at promoting clinician delivery of a secure firearm program to parents during well-child visits. A key outcome of interest is thus parent receipt of the program at each visit. Clinicians documented program delivery in patients' electronic health records for all visits, but their reporting is a proxy measure for the parent receipt outcome. Parents were also surveyed to report directly on program receipt after their child's visit; however, only a small subset of them completed the survey. Here, we develop a causal inference framework for a binary outcome that is subject to misclassification through silver-standard measures (clinician reports), but gold-standard measures (parent reports) are only available for a non-random internal validation subset. We propose a method for identifying the average treatment effect (ATE) that addresses the risk of bias due to misclassification and non-random validation selection, even when the outcome (parent receipt) may directly impact selection propensity (survey responsiveness). We show that ATE estimation relies on specifying the relationship between the gold- and silver-standard outcome measures in the validation subset, which may depend on treatment and covariates. Additionally, the clustered design is reflected in our causal assumptions and in our cluster-robust approach to estimation of the ATE. Simulation studies demonstrate acceptable finite-sample operating characteristics of our ATE estimator, supporting its application to ASPIRE."}
{"title":"Bridging Graph and State-Space Modeling for Intensive Care Unit Length of Stay Prediction","abstract":"Predicting a patient's length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a critical task for hospital resource management, yet remains challenging due to the heterogeneous and irregularly sampled nature of electronic health records (EHRs). In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic features. Experiments on the large-scale MIMIC-IV cohort dataset show that S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba, Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability analyses highlight the complementary contributions of each component of our architecture and underscore the importance of principled graph construction. These results demonstrate that S$^2$G-Net provides an effective and scalable solution for ICU LOS prediction with multi-modal clinical data.

{"title":"Evaluation and LLM-Guided Learning of ICD Coding Rationales","abstract":"Automated clinical coding involves mapping unstructured text from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to standardized code systems such as the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). While recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved the accuracy and efficiency of ICD coding, the lack of explainability in these models remains a major limitation, undermining trust and transparency. Current explorations about explainability largely rely on attention-based techniques and qualitative assessments by physicians, yet lack systematic evaluation using consistent criteria on high-quality rationale datasets, as well as dedicated approaches explicitly trained to generate rationales for further enhancing explanation. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the explainability of the rationales for ICD coding through two key lenses: faithfulness that evaluates how well explanations reflect the model's actual reasoning and plausibility that measures how consistent the explanations are with human expert judgment. To facilitate the evaluation of plausibility, we construct a new rationale-annotated dataset, offering denser annotations with diverse granularity and aligns better with current clinical practice, and conduct evaluation across three types of rationales of ICD coding. Encouraged by the promising plausibility of LLM-generated rationales for ICD coding, we further propose new rationale learning methods to improve the quality of model-generated rationales, where rationales produced by prompting LLMs with\/without annotation examples are used as distant supervision signals. We empirically find that LLM-generated rationales align most closely with those of human experts. Moreover, incorporating few-shot human-annotated examples not only further improves rationale generation but also enhances rationale-learning approaches."}
{"title":"Generative Foundation Model for Structured and Unstructured Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics, vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining, where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction (NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and 30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation, GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to additional modalities."}
{"title":"Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation vs. Long-Context Input for Clinical Reasoning over EHRs","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) are long, noisy, and often redundant, posing a major challenge for the clinicians who must navigate them. Large language models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for extracting and reasoning over this unstructured text, but the length of clinical notes often exceeds even state-of-the-art models' extended context windows. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) offers an alternative by retrieving task-relevant passages from across the entire EHR, potentially reducing the amount of required input tokens. In this work, we propose three clinical tasks designed to be replicable across health systems with minimal effort: 1) extracting imaging procedures, 2) generating timelines of antibiotic use, and 3) identifying key diagnoses. Using EHRs from actual hospitalized patients, we test three state-of-the-art LLMs with varying amounts of provided context, using either targeted text retrieval or the most recent clinical notes. We find that RAG closely matches or exceeds the performance of using recent notes, and approaches the performance of using the models' full context while requiring drastically fewer input tokens. Our results suggest that RAG remains a competitive and efficient approach even as newer models become capable of handling increasingly longer amounts of text."}
{"title":"When Algorithms Infer Gender: Revisiting Computational Phenotyping with Electronic Health Records Data","abstract":"Computational phenotyping has emerged as a practical solution to the incomplete collection of data on gender in electronic health records (EHRs). This approach relies on algorithms to infer a patient's gender using the available data in their health record, such as diagnosis codes, medication histories, and information in clinical notes. Although intended to improve the visibility of trans and gender-expansive populations in EHR-based biomedical research, computational phenotyping raises significant methodological and ethical concerns related to the potential misuse of algorithm outputs. In this paper, we review current practices for computational phenotyping of gender and examine its challenges through a critical lens. We also highlight existing recommendations for biomedical researchers and propose priorities for future work in this domain."}
{"title":"Smooth Flow Matching","abstract":"Functional data, i.e., smooth random functions observed over a continuous domain, are increasingly available in areas such as biomedical research, health informatics, and epidemiology. However, effective statistical analysis for functional data is often hindered by challenges such as privacy constraints, sparse and irregular sampling, infinite dimensionality, and non-Gaussian structures. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework named Smooth Flow Matching (SFM), tailored for generative modeling of functional data to enable statistical analysis without exposing sensitive real data. Built upon flow-matching ideas, SFM constructs a semiparametric copula flow to generate infinite-dimensional functional data, free from Gaussianity or low-rank assumptions. It is computationally efficient, handles irregular observations, and guarantees the smoothness of the generated functions, offering a practical and flexible solution in scenarios where existing deep generative methods are not applicable. Through extensive simulation studies, we demonstrate the advantages of SFM in terms of both synthetic data quality and computational efficiency. We then apply SFM to generate clinical trajectory data from the MIMIC-IV patient electronic health records (EHR) longitudinal database.

While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been available at https:\/\/github.com\/devilran6\/EAG-RL."}
{"title":"Bi-Axial Transformers: Addressing the Increasing Complexity of EHR Classification","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs), the digital representation of a patient's medical history, are a valuable resource for epidemiological and clinical research. They are also becoming increasingly complex, with recent trends indicating larger datasets, longer time series, and multi-modal integrations. Transformers, which have rapidly gained popularity due to their success in natural language processing and other domains, are well-suited to address these challenges due to their ability to model long-range dependencies and process data in parallel. But their application to EHR classification remains limited by data representations, which can reduce performance or fail to capture informative missingness. In this paper, we present the Bi-Axial Transformer (BAT), which attends to both the clinical variable and time point axes of EHR data to learn richer data relationships and address the difficulties of data sparsity. BAT achieves state-of-the-art performance on sepsis prediction and is competitive to top methods for mortality classification. In comparison to other transformers, BAT demonstrates increased robustness to data missingness, and learns unique sensor embeddings which can be used in transfer learning. Baseline models, which were previously located across multiple repositories or utilized deprecated libraries, were re-implemented with PyTorch and made available for reproduction and future benchmarking."}
{"title":"Extracting Post-Acute Sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 Infection Symptoms from Clinical Notes via Hybrid Natural Language Processing","abstract":"Accurately and efficiently diagnosing Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC) remains challenging due to its myriad symptoms that evolve over long- and variable-time intervals. To address this issue, we developed a hybrid natural language processing pipeline that integrates rule-based named entity recognition with BERT-based assertion detection modules for PASC-symptom extraction and assertion detection from clinical notes. We developed a comprehensive PASC lexicon with clinical specialists. From 11 health systems of the RECOVER initiative network across the U.S., we curated 160 intake progress notes for model development and evaluation, and collected 47,654 progress notes for a population-level prevalence study. We achieved an average F1 score of 0.82 in one-site internal validation and 0.76 in 10-site external validation for assertion detection. Our pipeline processed each note at $2.448\\pm 0.812$ seconds on average. Spearman correlation tests showed $\u03c1>0.83$ for positive mentions and $\u03c1>0.72$ for negative ones, both with $P <0.0001$. These demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our models and their potential for improving PASC diagnosis."}
{"title":"Predictive Multimodal Modeling of Diagnoses and Treatments in EHR","abstract":"While the ICD code assignment problem has been widely studied, most works have focused on post-discharge document classification. Models for early forecasting of this information could be used for identifying health risks, suggesting effective treatments, or optimizing resource allocation. To address the challenge of predictive modeling using the limited information at the beginning of a patient stay, we propose a multimodal system to fuse clinical notes and tabular events captured in electronic health records. The model integrates pre-trained encoders, feature pooling, and cross-modal attention to learn optimal representations across modalities and balance their presence at every temporal point. Moreover, we present a weighted temporal loss that adjusts its contribution at each point in time. Experiments show that these strategies enhance the early prediction model, outperforming the current state-of-the-art systems."}
{"title":"ParcoursVis: Visualization of Electronic Health Record Sequences at Scale","abstract":"We present ParcoursVis, an open-source Progressive Visual Analytics tool designed to explore aggregated electronic health record sequences of patients at scale. Existing tools are limited to about 20k patients that they can process fast enough to remain interactive, under human latency limits. They need to process the whole dataset before showing the visualization, taking a time proportional to the data size. Yet, managing large datasets allows for discovering rare medical conditions and unexpected patient pathways, contributing to improving treatments. To overcome this limitation, ParcoursVis relies on a progressive aggregation algorithm that quickly computes an approximate initial result, visualized as an Icicle tree, and improves it iteratively, until the whole computation is done. With its architecture, ParcoursVis remains interactive while visualizing the sequences of millions of patients -- three orders of magnitude more than similar tools. We describe our PVA architecture, which achieves scalability with fast convergence and visual stability."}
{"title":"HiRef: Leveraging Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for Robust Medication Recommendation","abstract":"Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However, real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions, largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes. To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings."}
{"title":"Uncertainty-Aware Prediction of Parkinson's Disease Medication Needs: A Two-Stage Conformal Prediction Approach","abstract":"Parkinson's Disease (PD) medication management presents unique challenges due to heterogeneous disease progression and treatment response. Neurologists must balance symptom control with optimal dopaminergic dosing based on functional disability while minimizing side effects. This balance is crucial as inadequate or abrupt changes can cause levodopa-induced dyskinesia, wearing off, and neuropsychiatric effects, significantly reducing quality of life. Current approaches rely on trial-and-error decisions without systematic predictive methods. Despite machine learning advances, clinical adoption remains limited due to reliance on point predictions that do not account for prediction uncertainty, undermining clinical trust and utility. Clinicians require not only predictions of future medication needs but also reliable confidence measures. Without quantified uncertainty, adjustments risk premature escalation to maximum doses or prolonged inadequate symptom control. We developed a conformal prediction framework anticipating medication needs up to two years in advance with reliable prediction intervals and statistical guarantees. Our approach addresses zero-inflation in PD inpatient data, where patients maintain stable medication regimens between visits. Using electronic health records from 631 inpatient admissions at University of Florida Health (2011-2021), our two-stage approach identifies patients likely to need medication changes, then predicts required levodopa equivalent daily dose adjustments. Our framework achieved marginal coverage while reducing prediction interval lengths compared to traditional approaches, providing precise predictions for short-term planning and wider ranges for long-term forecasting. By quantifying uncertainty, our approach enables evidence-based decisions about levodopa dosing, optimizing symptom control while minimizing side effects and improving life quality."}
{"title":"Interpretable Machine Learning Model for Early Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury in Critically Ill Patients with Cirrhosis: A Retrospective Study","abstract":"Background: Cirrhosis is a progressive liver disease with high mortality and frequent complications, notably acute kidney injury (AKI), which occurs in up to 50% of hospitalized patients and worsens outcomes. AKI stems from complex hemodynamic, inflammatory, and metabolic changes, making early detection essential. Many predictive tools lack accuracy, interpretability, and alignment with intensive care unit (ICU) workflows. This study developed an interpretable machine learning model for early AKI prediction in critically ill patients with cirrhosis.\n  Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of the MIMIC-IV v2.2 database, identifying 1240 adult ICU patients with cirrhosis and excluding those with ICU stays under 48 hours or missing key data. Laboratory and physiological variables from the first 48 hours were extracted. The pipeline included preprocessing, missingness filtering, LASSO feature selection, and SMOTE class balancing. Six algorithms-LightGBM, CatBoost, XGBoost, logistic regression, naive Bayes, and neural networks-were trained and evaluated using AUROC, accuracy, F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values.\n  Results: LightGBM achieved the best performance (AUROC 0.808, 95% CI 0.741-0.856; accuracy 0.704; NPV 0.911). Key predictors included prolonged partial thromboplastin time, absence of outside-facility 20G placement, low pH, and altered pO2, consistent with known cirrhosis-AKI mechanisms and suggesting actionable targets.\n  Conclusion: The LightGBM-based model enables accurate early AKI risk stratification in ICU patients with cirrhosis using routine clinical variables. Its high negative predictive value supports safe de-escalation for low-risk patients, and interpretability fosters clinician trust and targeted prevention. External validation and integration into electronic health record systems are warranted."}
{"title":"Improving ARDS Diagnosis Through Context-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models","abstract":"Large, publicly available clinical datasets have emerged as a novel resource for understanding disease heterogeneity and to explore personalization of therapy. These datasets are derived from data not originally collected for research purposes and, as a result, are often incomplete and lack critical labels. Many AI tools have been developed to retrospectively label these datasets, such as by performing disease classification; however, they often suffer from limited interpretability. Previous work has attempted to explain predictions using Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which learn interpretable concepts that map to higher-level clinical ideas, facilitating human evaluation. However, these models often experience performance limitations when the concepts fail to adequately explain or characterize the task. We use the identification of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as a challenging test case to demonstrate the value of incorporating contextual information from clinical notes to improve CBM performance. Our approach leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to process clinical notes and generate additional concepts, resulting in a 10% performance gain over existing methods. Additionally, it facilitates the learning of more comprehensive concepts, thereby reducing the risk of information leakage and reliance on spurious shortcuts, thus improving the characterization of ARDS."}
{"title":"Causal Machine Learning for Patient-Level Intraoperative Opioid Dose Prediction from Electronic Health Records","abstract":"This paper introduces the OPIAID algorithm, a novel approach for predicting and recommending personalized opioid dosages for individual patients. The algorithm optimizes pain management while minimizing opioid related adverse events (ORADE) by employing machine learning models trained on observational electronic health records (EHR) data. It leverages a causal machine learning approach to understand the relationship between opioid dose, case specific patient and intraoperative characteristics, and pain versus ORADE outcomes. The OPIAID algorithm considers patient-specific characteristics and the influence of different opiates, enabling personalized dose recommendations. This paper outlines the algorithm's methodology and architecture, and discusses key assumptions, and approaches to evaluating its performance."}
{"title":"P-CAFE: Personalized Cost-Aware Incremental Feature Selection For Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows. However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence while optimizing resource utilization."}
{"title":"MORE-CLEAR: Multimodal Offline Reinforcement learning for Clinical notes Leveraged Enhanced State Representation","abstract":"Sepsis, a life-threatening inflammatory response to infection, causes organ dysfunction, making early detection and optimal management critical. Previous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sepsis management rely primarily on structured data, such as lab results or vital signs, and on a dearth of a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Offline REinforcement learning for Clinical notes Leveraged Enhanced stAte Representation (MORE-CLEAR) framework for sepsis control in intensive care units. MORE-CLEAR employs pre-trained large-scale language models (LLMs) to facilitate the extraction of rich semantic representations from clinical notes, preserving clinical context and improving patient state representation. Gated fusion and cross-modal attention allow dynamic weight adjustment in the context of time and the effective integration of multimodal data. Extensive cross-validation using two public (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and one private dataset demonstrates that MORE-CLEAR significantly improves estimated survival rate and policy performance compared to single-modal RL approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first to leverage LLM capabilities within a multimodal offline RL for better state representation in medical applications. This approach can potentially expedite the treatment and management of sepsis by enabling reinforcement learning models to propose enhanced actions based on a more comprehensive understanding of patient conditions."}
{"title":"Early Detection of Pancreatic Cancer Using Multimodal Learning on Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is one of the deadliest cancers, and early detection remains a major clinical challenge due to the absence of specific symptoms and reliable biomarkers. In this work, we propose a new multimodal approach that integrates longitudinal diagnosis code histories and routinely collected laboratory measurements from electronic health records to detect PDAC up to one year prior to clinical diagnosis. Our method combines neural controlled differential equations to model irregular lab time series, pretrained language models and recurrent networks to learn diagnosis code trajectory representations, and cross-attention mechanisms to capture interactions between the two modalities. We develop and evaluate our approach on a real-world dataset of nearly 4,700 patients and achieve significant improvements in AUC ranging from 6.5% to 15.5% over state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our model identifies diagnosis codes and laboratory panels associated with elevated PDAC risk, including both established and new biomarkers.

{"title":"MoMA: A Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents Architecture for Enhancing Clinical Prediction Modelling","abstract":"Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data provide richer, complementary insights into patient health compared to single-modality data. However, effectively integrating diverse data modalities for clinical prediction modeling remains challenging due to the substantial data requirements. We introduce a novel architecture, Mixture-of-Multimodal-Agents (MoMA), designed to leverage multiple large language model (LLM) agents for clinical prediction tasks using multimodal EHR data. MoMA employs specialized LLM agents (\"specialist agents\") to convert non-textual modalities, such as medical images and laboratory results, into structured textual summaries. These summaries, together with clinical notes, are combined by another LLM (\"aggregator agent\") to generate a unified multimodal summary, which is then used by a third LLM (\"predictor agent\") to produce clinical predictions. Evaluating MoMA on three prediction tasks using real-world datasets with different modality combinations and prediction settings, MoMA outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its enhanced accuracy and flexibility across various tasks."}
{"title":"Prediction of Survival Outcomes under Clinical Presence Shift: A Joint Neural Network Architecture","abstract":"Electronic health records arise from the complex interaction between patients and the healthcare system. This observation process of interactions, referred to as clinical presence, often impacts observed outcomes. When using electronic health records to develop clinical prediction models, it is standard practice to overlook clinical presence, impacting performance and limiting the transportability of models when this interaction evolves. We propose a multi-task recurrent neural network that jointly models the inter-observation time and the missingness processes characterising this interaction in parallel to the survival outcome of interest. Our work formalises the concept of clinical presence shift when the prediction model is deployed in new settings (e.g. different hospitals, regions or countries), and we theoretically justify why the proposed joint modelling can improve transportability under changes in clinical presence. We demonstrate, in a real-world mortality prediction task in the MIMIC-III dataset, how the proposed strategy improves performance and transportability compared to state-of-the-art prediction models that do not incorporate the observation process. These results emphasise the importance of leveraging clinical presence to improve performance and create more transportable clinical prediction models."}
{"title":"Small Lesions-aware Bidirectional Multimodal Multiscale Fusion Network for Lung Disease Classification","abstract":"The diagnosis of medical diseases faces challenges such as the misdiagnosis of small lesions. Deep learning, particularly multimodal approaches, has shown great potential in the field of medical disease diagnosis. However, the differences in dimensionality between medical imaging and electronic health record data present challenges for effective alignment and fusion. To address these issues, we propose the Multimodal Multiscale Cross-Attention Fusion Network (MMCAF-Net). This model employs a feature pyramid structure combined with an efficient 3D multi-scale convolutional attention module to extract lesion-specific features from 3D medical images. To further enhance multimodal data integration, MMCAF-Net incorporates a multi-scale cross-attention module, which resolves dimensional inconsistencies, enabling more effective feature fusion. We evaluated MMCAF-Net on the Lung-PET-CT-Dx dataset, and the results showed a significant improvement in diagnostic accuracy, surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.

{"title":"Improving Hospital Risk Prediction with Knowledge-Augmented Multimodal EHR Modeling","abstract":"Accurate prediction of clinical outcomes using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is critical for early intervention, efficient resource allocation, and improved patient care. EHRs contain multimodal data, including both structured data and unstructured clinical notes that provide rich, context-specific information. In this work, we introduce a unified framework that seamlessly integrates these diverse modalities, leveraging all relevant available information through a two-stage architecture for clinical risk prediction. In the first stage, a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) extracts crucial, task-relevant information from clinical notes, which is enhanced by graph-based retrieval of external domain knowledge from sources such as a medical corpus like PubMed, grounding the LLM's understanding. The second stage combines both unstructured representations and features derived from the structured data to generate the final predictions. This approach supports a wide range of clinical tasks. Here, we demonstrate its effectiveness on 30-day readmission and in-hospital mortality prediction. Experimental results show that our framework achieves strong performance, with AUC scores of $0.84$ and $0.92$, respectively, despite these tasks involving severely imbalanced datasets, with positive rates ranging from approximately $4\\%$ to $13\\%$. Moreover, it outperforms all existing baselines and clinical practices, including established risk scoring systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks for healthcare prediction which enhances the power of an LLM-based graph-guided knowledge retrieval method by combining it with structured data for improved clinical outcome prediction."}
{"title":"Agent-Based Feature Generation from Clinical Notes for Outcome Prediction","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) contain rich unstructured clinical notes that could enhance predictive modeling, yet extracting meaningful features from these notes remains challenging. Current approaches range from labor-intensive manual clinician feature generation (CFG) to fully automated representational feature generation (RFG) that lack interpretability and clinical relevance. Here we introduce SNOW (Scalable Note-to-Outcome Workflow), a modular multi-agent system powered by large language models (LLMs) that autonomously generates structured clinical features from unstructured notes without human intervention. We evaluated SNOW against manual CFG, clinician-guided LLM approaches, and RFG methods for predicting 5-year prostate cancer recurrence in 147 patients from Stanford Healthcare. While manual CFG achieved the highest performance (AUC-ROC: 0.771), SNOW matched this performance (0.761) without requiring any clinical expertise, significantly outperforming both baseline features alone (0.691) and all RFG approaches. The clinician-guided LLM method also performed well (0.732) but still required expert input. SNOW's specialized agents handle feature discovery, extraction, validation, post-processing, and aggregation, creating interpretable features that capture complex clinical information typically accessible only through manual review. Our findings demonstrate that autonomous LLM systems can replicate expert-level feature engineering at scale, potentially transforming how clinical ML models leverage unstructured EHR data while maintaining the interpretability essential for clinical deployment."}
{"title":"Structure Maintained Representation Learning Neural Network for Causal Inference","abstract":"Recent developments in causal inference have greatly shifted the interest from estimating the average treatment effect to the individual treatment effect. In this article, we improve the predictive accuracy of representation learning and adversarial networks in estimating individual treatment effects by introducing a structure keeper which maintains the correlation between the baseline covariates and their corresponding representations in the high dimensional space. We train a discriminator at the end of representation layers to trade off representation balance and information loss. We show that the proposed discriminator minimizes an upper bound of the treatment estimation error. We can address the tradeoff between distribution balance and information loss by considering the correlations between the learned representation space and the original covariate feature space. We conduct extensive experiments with simulated and real-world observational data to show that our proposed Structure Maintained Representation Learning (SMRL) algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate the algorithms on real electronic health record data from the MIMIC-III database."}

Despite recent advances with large language models, achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse entity types while maintaining computational efficiency remains a significant challenge. We introduce OpenMed NER, a suite of open-source, domain-adapted transformer models that combine lightweight domain-adaptive pre-training (DAPT) with parameter-efficient Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach performs cost-effective DAPT on a 350k-passage corpus compiled from ethically sourced, publicly available research repositories and de-identified clinical notes (PubMed, arXiv, and MIMIC-III) using DeBERTa-v3, PubMedBERT, and BioELECTRA backbones. This is followed by task-specific fine-tuning with LoRA, which updates less than 1.5% of model parameters. We evaluate our models on 12 established biomedical NER benchmarks spanning chemicals, diseases, genes, and species. OpenMed NER achieves new state-of-the-art micro-F1 scores on 10 of these 12 datasets, with substantial gains across diverse entity types. Our models advance the state-of-the-art on foundational disease and chemical benchmarks (e.g., BC5CDR-Disease, +2.70 pp), while delivering even larger improvements of over 5.3 and 9.7 percentage points on more specialized gene and clinical cell line corpora. This work demonstrates that strategically adapted open-source models can surpass closed-source solutions. This performance is achieved with remarkable efficiency: training completes in under 12 hours on a single GPU with a low carbon footprint (< 1.2 kg CO2e), producing permissively licensed, open-source checkpoints designed to help practitioners facilitate compliance with emerging data protection and AI regulations, such as the EU AI Act."}
{"title":"TCDiff: Triplex Cascaded Diffusion for High-fidelity Multimodal EHRs Generation with Incomplete Clinical Data","abstract":"The scarcity of large-scale and high-quality electronic health records (EHRs) remains a major bottleneck in biomedical research, especially as large foundation models become increasingly data-hungry. Synthesizing substantial volumes of de-identified and high-fidelity data from existing datasets has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods suffer from a series of limitations: they struggle to model the intrinsic properties of heterogeneous multimodal EHR data (e.g., continuous, discrete, and textual modalities), capture the complex dependencies among them, and robustly handle pervasive data incompleteness. These challenges are particularly acute in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). To this end, we propose TCDiff (Triplex Cascaded Diffusion Network), a novel EHR generation framework that cascades three diffusion networks to learn the features of real-world EHR data, formatting a multi-stage generative process: Reference Modalities Diffusion, Cross-Modal Bridging, and Target Modality Diffusion. Furthermore, to validate our proposed framework, besides two public datasets, we also construct and introduce TCM-SZ1, a novel multimodal EHR dataset for benchmarking. Experimental results show that TCDiff consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 10% in data fidelity under various missing rate, while maintaining competitive privacy guarantees. This highlights the effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability of our approach in real-world healthcare scenarios."}
{"title":"Classification of Psychiatry Clinical Notes by Diagnosis: A Deep Learning and Machine Learning Approach","abstract":"The classification of clinical notes into specific diagnostic categories is critical in healthcare, especially for mental health conditions like Anxiety and Adjustment Disorder. In this study, we compare the performance of various Artificial Intelligence models, including both traditional Machine Learning approaches (Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors, Decision Tree, and eXtreme Gradient Boost) and Deep Learning models (DistilBERT and SciBERT), to classify clinical notes into these two diagnoses. Additionally, we implemented three oversampling strategies: No Oversampling, Random Oversampling, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), to assess their impact on model performance. Hyperparameter tuning was also applied to optimize model accuracy. Our results indicate that oversampling techniques had minimal impact on model performance overall. The only exception was SMOTE, which showed a positive effect specifically with BERT-based models. However, hyperparameter optimization significantly improved accuracy across the models, enhancing their ability to generalize and perform on the dataset. The Decision Tree and eXtreme Gradient Boost models achieved the highest accuracy among machine learning approaches, both reaching 96%, while the DistilBERT and SciBERT models also attained 96% accuracy in the deep learning category. These findings underscore the importance of hyperparameter tuning in maximizing model performance. This study contributes to the ongoing research on AI-assisted diagnostic tools in mental health by providing insights into the efficacy of different model architectures and data balancing methods."}
{"title":"TrajSurv: Learning Continuous Latent Trajectories from Electronic Health Records for Trustworthy Survival Prediction","abstract":"Trustworthy survival prediction is essential for clinical decision making. Longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) provide a uniquely powerful opportunity for the prediction. However, it is challenging to accurately model the continuous clinical progression of patients underlying the irregularly sampled clinical features and to transparently link the progression to survival outcomes. To address these challenges, we develop TrajSurv, a model that learns continuous latent trajectories from longitudinal EHR data for trustworthy survival prediction. TrajSurv employs a neural controlled differential equation (NCDE) to extract continuous-time latent states from the irregularly sampled data, forming continuous latent trajectories. To ensure the latent trajectories reflect the clinical progression, TrajSurv aligns the latent state space with patient state space through a time-aware contrastive learning approach. To transparently link clinical progression to the survival outcome, TrajSurv uses latent trajectories in a two-step divide-and-conquer interpretation process. First, it explains how the changes in clinical features translate into the latent trajectory's evolution using a learned vector field. Second, it clusters these latent trajectories to identify key clinical progression patterns associated with different survival outcomes. Evaluations on two real-world medical datasets, MIMIC-III and eICU, show TrajSurv's competitive accuracy and superior transparency over existing deep learning methods."}
{"title":"Similarity-Based Self-Construct Graph Model for Predicting Patient Criticalness Using Graph Neural Networks and EHR Data","abstract":"Accurately predicting the criticalness of ICU patients (such as in-ICU mortality risk) is vital for early intervention in critical care. However, conventional models often treat each patient in isolation and struggle to exploit the relational structure in Electronic Health Records (EHR). We propose a Similarity-Based Self-Construct Graph Model (SBSCGM) that dynamically builds a patient similarity graph from multi-modal EHR data, and a HybridGraphMedGNN architecture that operates on this graph to predict patient mortality and a continuous criticalness score. SBSCGM uses a hybrid similarity measure (combining feature-based and structural similarities) to connect patients with analogous clinical profiles in real-time. The HybridGraphMedGNN integrates Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), GraphSAGE, and Graph Attention Network (GAT) layers to learn robust patient representations, leveraging both local and global graph patterns. In experiments on 6,000 ICU stays from the MIMIC-III dataset, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance (AUC-ROC $0.94$) outperforming baseline classifiers and single-type GNN models. We also demonstrate improved precision\/recall and show that the attention mechanism provides interpretable insights into model predictions. Our framework offers a scalable and interpretable solution for critical care risk prediction, with potential to support clinicians in real-world ICU deployment."}
{"title":"TT-XAI: Trustworthy Clinical Text Explanations via Keyword Distillation and LLM Reasoning","abstract":"Clinical language models often struggle to provide trustworthy predictions and explanations when applied to lengthy, unstructured electronic health records (EHRs). This work introduces TT-XAI, a lightweight and effective framework that improves both classification performance and interpretability through domain-aware keyword distillation and reasoning with large language models (LLMs). First, we demonstrate that distilling raw discharge notes into concise keyword representations significantly enhances BERT classifier performance and improves local explanation fidelity via a focused variant of LIME. Second, we generate chain-of-thought clinical explanations using keyword-guided prompts to steer LLMs, producing more concise and clinically relevant reasoning. We evaluate explanation quality using deletion-based fidelity metrics, self-assessment via LLaMA-3 scoring, and a blinded human study with domain experts. All evaluation modalities consistently favor the keyword-augmented method, confirming that distillation enhances both machine and human interpretability. TT-XAI offers a scalable pathway toward trustworthy, auditable AI in clinical decision support."}

Additionally, we show how informativeness can help interpret the predictions of prognostic models trained on foundation model-derived representations."}
{"title":"CliCARE: Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for improving clinical decision support and reducing physician burnout by synthesizing complex, longitudinal cancer Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, their implementation in this critical field faces three primary challenges: the inability to effectively process the extensive length and multilingual nature of patient records for accurate temporal analysis; a heightened risk of clinical hallucination, as conventional grounding techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) do not adequately incorporate process-oriented clinical guidelines; and unreliable evaluation metrics that hinder the validation of AI systems in oncology. To address these issues, we propose CliCARE, a framework for Grounding Large Language Models in Clinical Guidelines for Decision Support over Longitudinal Cancer Electronic Health Records. The framework operates by transforming unstructured, longitudinal EHRs into patient-specific Temporal Knowledge Graphs (TKGs) to capture long-range dependencies, and then grounding the decision support process by aligning these real-world patient trajectories with a normative guideline knowledge graph. This approach provides oncologists with evidence-grounded decision support by generating a high-fidelity clinical summary and an actionable recommendation. We validated our framework using large-scale, longitudinal data from a private Chinese cancer dataset and the public English MIMIC-IV dataset. In these diverse settings, CliCARE significantly outperforms strong baselines, including leading long-context LLMs and Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG methods. The clinical validity of our results is supported by a robust evaluation protocol, which demonstrates a high correlation with assessments made by expert oncologists."}
{"title":"Personalized Treatment Effect Estimation from Unstructured Data","abstract":"Existing methods for estimating personalized treatment effects typically rely on structured covariates, limiting their applicability to unstructured data. Yet, leveraging unstructured data for causal inference has considerable application potential, for instance in healthcare, where clinical notes or medical images are abundant. To this end, we first introduce an approximate 'plug-in' method trained directly on the neural representations of unstructured data. However, when these fail to capture all confounding information, the method may be subject to confounding bias. We therefore introduce two theoretically grounded estimators that leverage structured measurements of the confounders during training, but allow estimating personalized treatment effects purely from unstructured inputs, while avoiding confounding bias. When these structured measurements are only available for a non-representative subset of the data, these estimators may suffer from sampling bias. To address this, we further introduce a regression-based correction that accounts for the non-uniform sampling, assuming the sampling mechanism is known or can be well-estimated. Our experiments on two benchmark datasets show that the plug-in method, directly trainable on large unstructured datasets, achieves strong empirical performance across all settings, despite its simplicity."}

While multimodal fusion is established, our work demonstrates that a simple yet interpretable BERT+RF pipeline delivers clinically significant improvements - particularly for intermediate cancer stages (Class 2\/3 recall: 0.900 combined vs 0.824 numerical\/0.725 textual). SHAP analysis provides transparent feature importance rankings, while ablation studies prove textual features' complementary value. This accessible approach offers hospitals a balance of high performance (F1=89%), computational efficiency, and clinical interpretability - addressing critical needs in prostate cancer diagnostics."}
{"title":"An MLI-Guided Framework for Subgroup-Aware Modeling in Electronic Health Records (AdaptHetero)","abstract":"Machine learning interpretation (MLI) has primarily been leveraged to foster clinician trust and extract insights from electronic health records (EHRs), rather than to guide subgroup-specific, operationalizable modeling strategies. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaptHetero, a novel MLI-driven framework that transforms interpretability insights into actionable guidance for tailoring model training and evaluation across subpopulations. Evaluated on three large-scale EHR datasets -- GOSSIS-1-eICU, WiDS, and MIMIC-IV -- AdaptHetero consistently uncovers heterogeneous model behaviors in predicting ICU mortality, in-hospital death, and hidden hypoxemia. Integrating SHAP-based interpretation with unsupervised clustering, AdaptHetero identifies clinically meaningful, subgroup-specific characteristics, improving predictive performance across many subpopulations (with gains up to 174.39 percent) while proactively flagging potential risks in others. These results highlight the framework's promise for more robust, equitable, and context-aware clinical deployment."}
{"title":"Embeddings to Diagnosis: Latent Fragility under Agentic Perturbations in Clinical LLMs","abstract":"LLMs for clinical decision support often fail under small but clinically meaningful input shifts such as masking a symptom or negating a finding, despite high performance on static benchmarks. These reasoning failures frequently go undetected by standard NLP metrics, which are insensitive to latent representation shifts that drive diagnosis instability. We propose a geometry-aware evaluation framework, LAPD (Latent Agentic Perturbation Diagnostics), which systematically probes the latent robustness of clinical LLMs under structured adversarial edits. Within this framework, we introduce Latent Diagnosis Flip Rate (LDFR), a model-agnostic diagnostic signal that captures representational instability when embeddings cross decision boundaries in PCA-reduced latent space. Clinical notes are generated using a structured prompting pipeline grounded in diagnostic reasoning, then perturbed along four axes: masking, negation, synonym replacement, and numeric variation to simulate common ambiguities and omissions. We compute LDFR across both foundation and clinical LLMs, finding that latent fragility emerges even under minimal surface-level changes. Finally, we validate our findings on 90 real clinical notes from the DiReCT benchmark (MIMIC-IV), confirming the generalizability of LDFR beyond synthetic settings. Our results reveal a persistent gap between surface robustness and semantic stability, underscoring the importance of geometry-aware auditing in safety-critical clinical AI."}
{"title":"HypKG: Hypergraph-based Knowledge Graph Contextualization for Precision Healthcare","abstract":"Knowledge graphs (KGs) are important products of the semantic web, which are widely used in various application domains. Healthcare is one of such domains where KGs are intensively used, due to the high requirement for knowledge accuracy and interconnected nature of healthcare data. However, KGs storing general factual information often lack the ability to account for important contexts of the knowledge such as the status of specific patients, which are crucial in precision healthcare. Meanwhile, electronic health records (EHRs) provide rich personal data, including various diagnoses and medications, which provide natural contexts for general KGs. In this paper, we propose HypKG, a framework that integrates patient information from EHRs into KGs to generate contextualized knowledge representations for accurate healthcare predictions. Using advanced entity-linking techniques, we connect relevant knowledge from general KGs with patient information from EHRs, and then utilize a hypergraph model to \"contextualize\" the knowledge with the patient information. Finally, we employ hypergraph transformers guided by downstream prediction tasks to jointly learn proper contextualized representations for both KGs and patients, fully leveraging existing knowledge in KGs and patient contexts in EHRs. In experiments using a large biomedical KG and two real-world EHR datasets, HypKG demonstrates significant improvements in healthcare prediction tasks across multiple evaluation metrics. Additionally, by integrating external contexts, HypKG can learn to adjust the representations of entities and relations in KG, potentially improving the quality and real-world utility of knowledge."}
{"title":"A chart review process aided by natural language processing and multi-wave adaptive sampling to expedite validation of code-based algorithms for large database studies","abstract":"Background: One of the ways to enhance analyses conducted with large claims databases is by validating the measurement characteristics of code-based algorithms used to identify health outcomes or other key study parameters of interest. These metrics can be used in quantitative bias analyses to assess the robustness of results for an inferential study given potential bias from outcome misclassification. However, extensive time and resource allocation are typically re-quired to create reference-standard labels through manual chart review of free-text notes from linked electronic health records. Methods: We describe an expedited process that introduces efficiency in a validation study us-ing two distinct mechanisms: 1) use of natural language processing (NLP) to reduce time spent by human reviewers to review each chart, and 2) a multi-wave adaptive sampling approach with pre-defined criteria to stop the validation study once performance characteristics are identified with sufficient precision. We illustrate this process in a case study that validates the performance of a claims-based outcome algorithm for intentional self-harm in patients with obesity. Results: We empirically demonstrate that the NLP-assisted annotation process reduced the time spent on review per chart by 40% and use of the pre-defined stopping rule with multi-wave samples would have prevented review of 77% of patient charts with limited compromise to precision in derived measurement characteristics. Conclusion: This approach could facilitate more routine validation of code-based algorithms used to define key study parameters, ultimately enhancing understanding of the reliability of find-ings derived from database studies."}
{"title":"DR.EHR: Dense Retrieval for Electronic Health Record with Knowledge Injection and Synthetic Data","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are pivotal in clinical practices, yet their retrieval remains a challenge mainly due to semantic gap issues. Recent advancements in dense retrieval offer promising solutions but existing models, both general-domain and biomedical-domain, fall short due to insufficient medical knowledge or mismatched training corpora. This paper introduces \\texttt{DR.EHR}, a series of dense retrieval models specifically tailored for EHR retrieval. We propose a two-stage training pipeline utilizing MIMIC-IV discharge summaries to address the need for extensive medical knowledge and large-scale training data. The first stage involves medical entity extraction and knowledge injection from a biomedical knowledge graph, while the second stage employs large language models to generate diverse training data. We train two variants of \\texttt{DR.EHR}, with 110M and 7B parameters, respectively. Evaluated on the CliniQ benchmark, our models significantly outperforms all existing dense retrievers, achieving state-of-the-art results. Detailed analyses confirm our models' superiority across various match and query types, particularly in challenging semantic matches like implication and abbreviation. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each pipeline component, and supplementary experiments on EHR QA datasets demonstrate the models' generalizability on natural language questions, including complex ones with multiple entities. This work significantly advances EHR retrieval, offering a robust solution for clinical applications."}
{"title":"From Feedback to Checklists: Grounded Evaluation of AI-Generated Clinical Notes","abstract":"AI-generated clinical notes are increasingly used in healthcare, but evaluating their quality remains a challenge due to high subjectivity and limited scalability of expert review. Existing automated metrics often fail to align with real-world physician preferences. To address this, we propose a pipeline that systematically distills real user feedback into structured checklists for note evaluation. These checklists are designed to be interpretable, grounded in human feedback, and enforceable by LLM-based evaluators. Using deidentified data from over 21,000 clinical encounters (prepared in accordance with the HIPAA safe harbor standard) from a deployed AI medical scribe system, we show that our feedback-derived checklist outperforms a baseline approach in our offline evaluations in coverage, diversity, and predictive power for human ratings. Extensive experiments confirm the checklist's robustness to quality-degrading perturbations, significant alignment with clinician preferences, and practical value as an evaluation methodology. In offline research settings, our checklist offers a practical tool for flagging notes that may fall short of our defined quality standards."}
{"title":"Multi-Label Classification with Generative AI Models in Healthcare: A Case Study of Suicidality and Risk Factors","abstract":"Suicide remains a pressing global health crisis, with over 720,000 deaths annually and millions more affected by suicide ideation (SI) and suicide attempts (SA). Early identification of suicidality-related factors (SrFs), including SI, SA, exposure to suicide (ES), and non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), is critical for timely intervention. While prior studies have applied AI to detect SrFs in clinical notes, most treat suicidality as a binary classification task, overlooking the complexity of cooccurring risk factors. This study explores the use of generative large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.5, for multi-label classification (MLC) of SrFs from psychiatric electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel end to end generative MLC pipeline and introduce advanced evaluation methods, including label set level metrics and a multilabel confusion matrix for error analysis. Finetuned GPT-3.5 achieved top performance with 0.94 partial match accuracy and 0.91 F1 score, while GPT-4.5 with guided prompting showed superior performance across label sets, including rare or minority label sets, indicating a more balanced and robust performance. Our findings reveal systematic error patterns, such as the conflation of SI and SA, and highlight the models tendency toward cautious over labeling. This work not only demonstrates the feasibility of using generative AI for complex clinical classification tasks but also provides a blueprint for structuring unstructured EHR data to support large scale clinical research and evidence based medicine."}
{"title":"Optimal two-phase sampling designs for generalized raking estimators with multiple parameters of interest","abstract":"Large observational datasets compiled from electronic health records are a valuable resource for medical research but are often affected by measurement error and misclassification. Valid statistical inference requires proper adjustment for these errors. Two-phase sampling with generalized raking (GR) estimation is an efficient solution to this problem that is robust to complex error structures. In this approach, error-prone variables are observed in a large phase 1 cohort, and a subset is selected in phase 2 for validation with error-free measurements. Previous research has studied optimal phase 2 sampling designs for inverse probability weighted (IPW) estimators in non-adaptive, multi-parameter settings, and for GR estimators in single-parameter settings. In this work, we extend these results by deriving optimal adaptive, multiwave sampling designs for IPW and GR estimators when multiple parameters are of interest. We propose several practical allocation strategies and evaluate their performance through extensive simulations and a data example from the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic HIV Study. Our results show that independently optimizing allocation for each parameter improves efficiency over traditional case-control sampling. We also derive an integer-valued, A-optimal allocation method that typically outperforms independent optimization. Notably, we find that optimal designs for GR can differ substantially from those for IPW, and that this distinction can meaningfully affect estimator efficiency in the multiple-parameter setting. These findings offer practical guidance for future two-phase studies using error-prone data."}

{"title":"Design of an Edge-based Portable EHR System for Anemia Screening in Remote Health Applications","abstract":"The design of medical systems for remote, resource-limited environments faces persistent challenges due to poor interoperability, lack of offline support, and dependency on costly infrastructure. Many existing digital health solutions neglect these constraints, limiting their effectiveness for frontline health workers in underserved regions. This paper presents a portable, edge-enabled Electronic Health Record platform optimized for offline-first operation, secure patient data management, and modular diagnostic integration. Running on small-form factor embedded devices, it provides AES-256 encrypted local storage with optional cloud synchronization for interoperability. As a use case, we integrated a non-invasive anemia screening module leveraging fingernail pallor analysis. Trained on 250 patient cases (27\\% anemia prevalence) with KDE-balanced data, the Random Forest model achieved a test RMSE of 1.969 g\/dL and MAE of 1.490 g\/dL. A severity-based model reached 79.2\\% sensitivity. To optimize performance, a YOLOv8n-based nail bed detector was quantized to INT8, reducing inference latency from 46.96 ms to 21.50 ms while maintaining mAP@0.5 at 0.995. The system emphasizes low-cost deployment, modularity, and data privacy compliance (HIPAA\/GDPR), addressing critical barriers to digital health adoption in disconnected settings. Our work demonstrates a scalable approach to enhance portable health information systems and support frontline healthcare in underserved regions."}
{"title":"Time-Aware Attention for Enhanced Electronic Health Records Modeling","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHR) contain valuable clinical information for predicting patient outcomes and guiding healthcare decisions. However, effectively modeling Electronic Health Records (EHRs) requires addressing data heterogeneity and complex temporal patterns. Standard approaches often struggle with irregular time intervals between clinical events. We propose TALE-EHR, a Transformer-based framework featuring a novel time-aware attention mechanism that explicitly models continuous temporal gaps to capture fine-grained sequence dynamics. To complement this temporal modeling with robust semantics, TALE-EHR leverages embeddings derived from standardized code descriptions using a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM), providing a strong foundation for understanding clinical concepts. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV and PIC dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on tasks such as disease progression forecasting. TALE-EHR underscores the benefit of integrating explicit, continuous temporal modeling with strong semantic representations provides a powerful solution for advancing EHR analysis."}
{"title":"Benchmarking Foundation Models with Multimodal Public Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Foundation models have emerged as a powerful approach for processing electronic health records (EHRs), offering flexibility to handle diverse medical data modalities. In this study, we present a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the performance, fairness, and interpretability of foundation models, both as unimodal encoders and as multimodal learners, using the publicly available MIMIC-IV database. To support consistent and reproducible evaluation, we developed a standardized data processing pipeline that harmonizes heterogeneous clinical records into an analysis-ready format. We systematically compared eight foundation models, encompassing both unimodal and multimodal models, as well as domain-specific and general-purpose variants. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating multiple data modalities leads to consistent improvements in predictive performance without introducing additional bias. Through this benchmark, we aim to support the development of effective and trustworthy multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) systems for real-world clinical applications.

{"title":"Toward Temporal Causal Representation Learning with Tensor Decomposition","abstract":"Temporal causal representation learning is a powerful tool for uncovering complex patterns in observational studies, which are often represented as low-dimensional time series. However, in many real-world applications, data are high-dimensional with varying input lengths and naturally take the form of irregular tensors. To analyze such data, irregular tensor decomposition is critical for extracting meaningful clusters that capture essential information. In this paper, we focus on modeling causal representation learning based on the transformed information. First, we present a novel causal formulation for a set of latent clusters. We then propose CaRTeD, a joint learning framework that integrates temporal causal representation learning with irregular tensor decomposition. Notably, our framework provides a blueprint for downstream tasks using the learned tensor factors, such as modeling latent structures and extracting causal information, and offers a more flexible regularization design to enhance tensor decomposition. Theoretically, we show that our algorithm converges to a stationary point. More importantly, our results fill the gap in theoretical guarantees for the convergence of state-of-the-art irregular tensor decomposition. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world electronic health record (EHR) datasets (MIMIC-III), with extensive benchmarks from both phenotyping and network recovery perspectives, demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and enhances the explainability of causal representations."}
{"title":"DENSE: Longitudinal Progress Note Generation with Temporal Modeling of Heterogeneous Clinical Notes Across Hospital Visits","abstract":"Progress notes are among the most clinically meaningful artifacts in an Electronic Health Record (EHR), offering temporally grounded insights into a patient's evolving condition, treatments, and care decisions. Despite their importance, they are severely underrepresented in large-scale EHR datasets. For instance, in the widely used Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) dataset, only about $8.56\\%$ of hospital visits include progress notes, leaving gaps in longitudinal patient narratives. In contrast, the dataset contains a diverse array of other note types, each capturing different aspects of care.\n  We present DENSE (Documenting Evolving Progress Notes from Scattered Evidence), a system designed to align with clinical documentation workflows by simulating how physicians reference past encounters while drafting progress notes. The system introduces a fine-grained note categorization and a temporal alignment mechanism that organizes heterogeneous notes across visits into structured, chronological inputs. At its core, DENSE leverages a clinically informed retrieval strategy to identify temporally and semantically relevant content from both current and prior visits. This retrieved evidence is used to prompt a large language model (LLM) to generate clinically coherent and temporally aware progress notes.\n  We evaluate DENSE on a curated cohort of patients with multiple visits and complete progress note documentation. The generated notes demonstrate strong longitudinal fidelity, achieving a temporal alignment ratio of $1.089$, surpassing the continuity observed in original notes. By restoring narrative coherence across fragmented documentation, our system supports improved downstream tasks such as summarization, predictive modeling, and clinical decision support, offering a scalable solution for LLM-driven note synthesis in real-world healthcare settings."}
{"title":"CU-ICU: Customizing Unsupervised Instruction-Finetuned Language Models for ICU Datasets via Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer","abstract":"Integrating large language models into specialized domains like healthcare presents unique challenges, including domain adaptation and limited labeled data. We introduce CU-ICU, a method for customizing unsupervised instruction-finetuned language models for ICU datasets by leveraging the Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer (T5) architecture. CU-ICU employs a sparse fine-tuning approach that combines few-shot prompting with selective parameter updates, enabling efficient adaptation with minimal supervision. Our evaluation across critical ICU tasks--early sepsis detection, mortality prediction, and clinical note generation--demonstrates that CU-ICU consistently improves predictive accuracy and interpretability over standard fine-tuning methods. Notably, CU-ICU achieves up to a 15% increase in sepsis detection accuracy and a 20% enhancement in generating clinically relevant explanations while updating fewer than 1% of model parameters in its most efficient configuration. These results establish CU-ICU as a scalable, low-overhead solution for delivering accurate and interpretable clinical decision support in real-world ICU environments."}

{"title":"TrialCompass: Visual Analytics for Enhancing the Eligibility Criteria Design of Clinical Trials","abstract":"Eligibility criteria play a critical role in clinical trials by determining the target patient population, which significantly influences the outcomes of medical interventions. However, current approaches for designing eligibility criteria have limitations to support interactive exploration of the large space of eligibility criteria. They also ignore incorporating detailed characteristics from the original electronic health record (EHR) data for criteria refinement. To address these limitations, we proposed TrialCompass, a visual analytics system integrating a novel workflow, which can empower clinicians to iteratively explore the vast space of eligibility criteria through knowledge-driven and outcome-driven approaches. TrialCompass supports history-tracking to help clinicians trace the evolution of their adjustments and decisions when exploring various forms of data (i.e., eligibility criteria, outcome metrics, and detailed characteristics of original EHR data) through these two approaches. This feature can help clinicians comprehend the impact of eligibility criteria on outcome metrics and patient characteristics, which facilitates systematic refinement of eligibility criteria. Using a real-world dataset, we demonstrated the effectiveness of TrialCompass in providing insights into designing eligibility criteria for septic shock and sepsis-associated acute kidney injury. We also discussed the research prospects of applying visual analytics to clinical trials."}
{"title":"Infherno: End-to-end Agent-based FHIR Resource Synthesis from Free-form Clinical Notes","abstract":"For clinical data integration and healthcare services, the HL7 FHIR standard has established itself as a desirable format for interoperability between complex health data. Previous attempts at automating the translation from free-form clinical notes into structured FHIR resources rely on modular, rule-based systems or LLMs with instruction tuning and constrained decoding. Since they frequently suffer from limited generalizability and structural inconformity, we propose an end-to-end framework powered by LLM agents, code execution, and healthcare terminology database tools to address these issues. Our solution, called Infherno, is designed to adhere to the FHIR document schema and competes well with a human baseline in predicting FHIR resources from unstructured text. The implementation features a front end for custom and synthetic data and both local and proprietary models, supporting clinical data integration processes and interoperability across institutions."}
{"title":"Striking the Perfect Balance: Preserving Privacy While Boosting Utility in Collaborative Medical Prediction Platforms","abstract":"Online collaborative medical prediction platforms offer convenience and real-time feedback by leveraging massive electronic health records. However, growing concerns about privacy and low prediction quality can deter patient participation and doctor cooperation. In this paper, we first clarify the privacy attacks, namely attribute attacks targeting patients and model extraction attacks targeting doctors, and specify the corresponding privacy principles. We then propose a privacy-preserving mechanism and integrate it into a novel one-shot distributed learning framework, aiming to simultaneously meet both privacy requirements and prediction performance objectives. Within the framework of statistical learning theory, we theoretically demonstrate that the proposed distributed learning framework can achieve the optimal prediction performance under specific privacy requirements. We further validate the developed privacy-preserving collaborative medical prediction platform through both toy simulations and real-world data experiments."}

While existing prediction models primarily leverage structured data, unstructured clinical notes contain valuable early indicators. This study introduces a novel LLM-augmented clinical NLP pipeline that employs domain-adapted large language models for symptom extraction, contextual reasoning, and correlation from free-text reports. Our approach integrates cardiovascular-specific fine-tuning, prompt-based inference, and entity-aware reasoning. Evaluations on MIMIC-III and CARDIO-NLP datasets demonstrate improved performance in precision, recall, F1-score, and AUROC, with high clinical relevance (kappa = 0.82) assessed by cardiologists. Challenges such as contextual hallucination, which occurs when plausible information contracts with provided source, and temporal ambiguity, which is related with models struggling with chronological ordering of events are addressed using prompt engineering and hybrid rule-based verification.

Materials and Methods: We compared traditional ML models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), and XGBoost) with our developed model, SurgeryLSTM, a masked bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) with an attention, using structured perioperative electronic health records (EHR) data. Performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R2), and key predictors were identified using explainable AI. Results: SurgeryLSTM achieved the highest predictive accuracy (R2=0.86), outperforming XGBoost (R2 = 0.85) and baseline models. The attention mechanism improved interpretability by dynamically identifying influential temporal segments within preoperative clinical sequences, allowing clinicians to trace which events or features most contributed to each LOS prediction. Key predictors of LOS included bone disorder, chronic kidney disease, and lumbar fusion identified as the most impactful predictors of LOS. Discussion: Temporal modeling with attention mechanisms significantly improves LOS prediction by capturing the sequential nature of patient data. Unlike static models, SurgeryLSTM provides both higher accuracy and greater interpretability, which are critical for clinical adoption. These results highlight the potential of integrating attention-based temporal models into hospital planning workflows. Conclusion: SurgeryLSTM presents an effective and interpretable AI solution for LOS prediction in elective spine surgery. Our findings support the integration of temporal, explainable ML approaches into clinical decision support systems to enhance discharge readiness and individualized patient care."}

Methods: We identified linguistic features of doubt markers and stigmatizing labels in MIMIC-III EHR via expanded lexicon matching and supervised learning classifiers. Predictors of rates of linguistic features were assessed using Poisson regression models. Results: We found higher rates of stigmatizing labels per chart among patients who were Black or African American (RR: 1.16), patients with Medicare\/Medicaid or government-run insurance (RR: 2.46), self-pay (RR: 2.12), and patients with a variety of stigmatizing disease and mental health conditions. Patterns among doubt markers were similar, though male patients had higher rates of doubt markers (RR: 1.25). We found increased stigmatizing labels used by nurses (RR: 1.40), and social workers (RR: 2.25), with similar patterns of doubt markers.

{"title":"Towards Collaborative Fairness in Federated Learning Under Imbalanced Covariate Shift","abstract":"Collaborative fairness is a crucial challenge in federated learning. However, existing approaches often overlook a practical yet complex form of heterogeneity: imbalanced covariate shift. We provide a theoretical analysis of this setting, which motivates the design of FedAKD (Federated Asynchronous Knowledge Distillation)- simple yet effective approach that balances accurate prediction with collaborative fairness. FedAKD consists of client and server updates. In the client update, we introduce a novel asynchronous knowledge distillation strategy based on our preliminary analysis, which reveals that while correctly predicted samples exhibit similar feature distributions across clients, incorrectly predicted samples show significant variability. This suggests that imbalanced covariate shift primarily arises from misclassified samples. Leveraging this insight, our approach first applies traditional knowledge distillation to update client models while keeping the global model fixed. Next, we select correctly predicted high-confidence samples and update the global model using these samples while keeping client models fixed. The server update simply aggregates all client models. We further provide a theoretical proof of FedAKD's convergence. Experimental results on public datasets (FashionMNIST and CIFAR10) and a real-world Electronic Health Records (EHR) dataset demonstrate that FedAKD significantly improves collaborative fairness, enhances predictive accuracy, and fosters client participation even under highly heterogeneous data distributions."}
{"title":"Late Fusion Multi-task Learning for Semiparametric Inference with Nuisance Parameters","abstract":"In the age of large and heterogeneous datasets, the integration of information from diverse sources is essential to improve parameter estimation. Multi-task learning offers a powerful approach by enabling simultaneous learning across related tasks. In this work, we introduce a late fusion framework for multi-task learning with semiparametric models that involve infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters, focusing on applications such as heterogeneous treatment effect estimation across multiple data sources, including electronic health records from different hospitals or clinical trial data. Our framework is two-step: first, initial double machine-learning estimators are obtained through individual task learning; second, these estimators are adaptively aggregated to exploit task similarities while remaining robust to task-specific differences. In particular, the framework avoids individual level data sharing, preserving privacy. Additionally, we propose a novel multi-task learning method for nuisance parameter estimation, which further enhances parameter estimation when nuisance parameters exhibit similarity across tasks. We establish theoretical guarantees for the method, demonstrating faster convergence rates compared to individual task learning when tasks share similar parametric components. Extensive simulations and real data applications complement the theoretical findings of our work while highlight the effectiveness of our framework even in moderate sample sizes."}

We introduce SynthEHR-Eviction, a scalable pipeline combining LLMs, human-in-the-loop annotation, and automated prompt optimization (APO) to extract eviction statuses from clinical notes. Using this pipeline, we created the largest public eviction-related SDoH dataset to date, comprising 14 fine-grained categories. Fine-tuned LLMs (e.g., Qwen2.5, LLaMA3) trained on SynthEHR-Eviction achieved Macro-F1 scores of 88.8% (eviction) and 90.3% (other SDoH) on human validated data, outperforming GPT-4o-APO (87.8%, 87.3%), GPT-4o-mini-APO (69.1%, 78.1%), and BioBERT (60.7%, 68.3%), while enabling cost-effective deployment across various model sizes.

Using text-based representation and compression techniques, RawMed captures complex structures and temporal dynamics with minimal preprocessing. We also propose a new evaluation framework for multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional similarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy.

However, real-world applications face two key challenges: (1) patient data is highly unstructured, heterogeneous, and scattered across multiple note types and (2) clinical notes are often long and semantically dense, making naive prompting infeasible due to context length constraints and the risk of omitting clinically relevant information.\n  We introduce CLI-RAG (Clinically Informed Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a domain-specific framework for structured and clinically grounded text generation using LLMs. It incorporates a novel hierarchical chunking strategy that respects clinical document structure and introduces a task-specific dual-stage retrieval mechanism. The global stage identifies relevant note types using evidence-based queries, while the local stage extracts high-value content within those notes creating relevance at both document and section levels.\n  We apply the system to generate structured progress notes for individual hospital visits using 15 clinical note types from the MIMIC-III dataset. Experiments show that it preserves temporal and semantic alignment across visits, achieving an average alignment score of 87.7%, surpassing the 80.7% baseline from real clinician-authored notes. The generated outputs also demonstrate high consistency across LLMs, reinforcing deterministic behavior essential for reproducibility, reliability, and clinical trust."}
{"title":"Bridging Data Gaps of Rare Conditions in ICU: A Multi-Disease Adaptation Approach for Clinical Prediction","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence has revolutionised critical care for common conditions. Yet, rare conditions in the intensive care unit (ICU), including recognised rare diseases and low-prevalence conditions in the ICU, remain underserved due to data scarcity and intra-condition heterogeneity. To bridge such gaps, we developed KnowRare, a domain adaptation-based deep learning framework for predicting clinical outcomes for rare conditions in the ICU. KnowRare mitigates data scarcity by initially learning condition-agnostic representations from diverse electronic health records through self-supervised pre-training. It addresses intra-condition heterogeneity by selectively adapting knowledge from clinically similar conditions with a developed condition knowledge graph. Evaluated on two ICU datasets across five clinical prediction tasks (90-day mortality, 30-day readmission, ICU mortality, remaining length of stay, and phenotyping), KnowRare consistently outperformed existing state-of-the-art models. Additionally, KnowRare demonstrated superior predictive performance compared to established ICU scoring systems, including APACHE IV and IV-a. Case studies further demonstrated KnowRare's flexibility in adapting its parameters to accommodate dataset-specific and task-specific characteristics, its generalisation to common conditions under limited data scenarios, and its rationality in selecting source conditions. These findings highlight KnowRare's potential as a robust and practical solution for supporting clinical decision-making and improving care for rare conditions in the ICU."}
{"title":"MedGemma Technical Report","abstract":"Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential in healthcare applications, but its training and deployment faces challenges due to healthcare's diverse data, complex tasks, and the need to preserve privacy. Foundation models that perform well on medical tasks and require less task-specific tuning data are critical to accelerate the development of healthcare AI applications. We introduce MedGemma, a collection of medical vision-language foundation models based on Gemma 3 4B and 27B. MedGemma demonstrates advanced medical understanding and reasoning on images and text, significantly exceeding the performance of similar-sized generative models and approaching the performance of task-specific models, while maintaining the general capabilities of the Gemma 3 base models. For out-of-distribution tasks, MedGemma achieves 2.6-10% improvement on medical multimodal question answering, 15.5-18.1% improvement on chest X-ray finding classification, and 10.8% improvement on agentic evaluations compared to the base models. Fine-tuning MedGemma further improves performance in subdomains, reducing errors in electronic health record information retrieval by 50% and reaching comparable performance to existing specialized state-of-the-art methods for pneumothorax classification and histopathology patch classification. We additionally introduce MedSigLIP, a medically-tuned vision encoder derived from SigLIP. MedSigLIP powers the visual understanding capabilities of MedGemma and as an encoder achieves comparable or better performance than specialized medical image encoders. Taken together, the MedGemma collection provides a strong foundation of medical image and text capabilities, with potential to significantly accelerate medical research and development of downstream applications. The MedGemma collection, including tutorials and model weights, can be found at https:\/\/goo.gle\/medgemma."}
{"title":"Improving Social Determinants of Health Documentation in French EHRs Using Large Language Models","abstract":"Social determinants of health (SDoH) significantly influence health outcomes, shaping disease progression, treatment adherence, and health disparities. However, their documentation in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is often incomplete or missing. This study presents an approach based on large language models (LLMs) for extracting 13 SDoH categories from French clinical notes. We trained Flan-T5-Large on annotated social history sections from clinical notes at Nantes University Hospital, France. We evaluated the model at two levels: (i) identification of SDoH categories and associated values, and (ii) extraction of detailed SDoH with associated temporal and quantitative information. The model performance was assessed across four datasets, including two that we publicly release as open resources. The model achieved strong performance for identifying well-documented categories such as living condition, marital status, descendants, job, tobacco, and alcohol use (F1 score > 0.80). Performance was lower for categories with limited training data or highly variable expressions, such as employment status, housing, physical activity, income, and education. Our model identified 95.8% of patients with at least one SDoH, compared to 2.8% for ICD-10 codes from structured EHR data. Our error analysis showed that performance limitations were linked to annotation inconsistencies, reliance on English-centric tokenizer, and reduced generalizability due to the model being trained on social history sections only. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NLP in improving the completeness of real-world SDoH data in a non-English EHR system."}
{"title":"Federated Learning for ICD Classification with Lightweight Models and Pretrained Embeddings","abstract":"This study investigates the feasibility and performance of federated learning (FL) for multi-label ICD code classification using clinical notes from the MIMIC-IV dataset. Unlike previous approaches that rely on centralized training or fine-tuned large language models, we propose a lightweight and scalable pipeline combining frozen text embeddings with simple multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifiers. This design offers a privacy-preserving and deployment-efficient alternative for clinical NLP applications, particularly suited to distributed healthcare settings. Extensive experiments across both centralized and federated configurations were conducted, testing six publicly available embedding models from Massive Text Embedding Benchmark leaderboard and three MLP classifier architectures under two medical coding (ICD-9 and ICD-10). Additionally, ablation studies over ten random stratified splits assess performance stability. Results show that embedding quality substantially outweighs classifier complexity in determining predictive performance, and that federated learning can closely match centralized results in idealized conditions. While the models are orders of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art architectures and achieved competitive micro and macro F1 scores, limitations remain including the lack of end-to-end training and the simplified FL assumptions. Nevertheless, this work demonstrates a viable way toward scalable, privacy-conscious medical coding systems and offers a step toward for future research into federated, domain-adaptive clinical AI."}
{"title":"Medical Data Pecking: A Context-Aware Approach for Automated Quality Evaluation of Structured Medical Data","abstract":"Background: The use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for epidemiological studies and artificial intelligence (AI) training is increasing rapidly. The reliability of the results depends on the accuracy and completeness of EHR data. However, EHR data often contain significant quality issues, including misrepresentations of subpopulations, biases, and systematic errors, as they are primarily collected for clinical and billing purposes. Existing quality assessment methods remain insufficient, lacking systematic procedures to assess data fitness for research.\n  Methods: We present the Medical Data Pecking approach, which adapts unit testing and coverage concepts from software engineering to identify data quality concerns. We demonstrate our approach using the Medical Data Pecking Tool (MDPT), which consists of two main components: (1) an automated test generator that uses large language models and grounding techniques to create a test suite from data and study descriptions, and (2) a data testing framework that executes these tests, reporting potential errors and coverage.\n  Results: We evaluated MDPT on three datasets: All of Us (AoU), MIMIC-III, and SyntheticMass, generating 55-73 tests per cohort across four conditions. These tests correctly identified 20-43 non-aligned or non-conforming data issues. We present a detailed analysis of the LLM-generated test suites in terms of reference grounding and value accuracy.\n  Conclusion: Our approach incorporates external medical knowledge to enable context-sensitive data quality testing as part of the data analysis workflow to improve the validity of its outcomes. Our approach tackles these challenges from a quality assurance perspective, laying the foundation for further development such as additional data modalities and improved grounding methods."}
{"title":"DynamiCare: A Dynamic Multi-Agent Framework for Interactive and Open-Ended Medical Decision-Making","abstract":"The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the development of specialized AI agents with domain-specific reasoning and interaction capabilities, particularly in healthcare. While recent frameworks simulate medical decision-making, they largely focus on single-turn tasks where a doctor agent receives full case information upfront -- diverging from the real-world diagnostic process, which is inherently uncertain, interactive, and iterative. In this paper, we introduce MIMIC-Patient, a structured dataset built from the MIMIC-III electronic health records (EHRs), designed to support dynamic, patient-level simulations. Building on this, we propose DynamiCare, a novel dynamic multi-agent framework that models clinical diagnosis as a multi-round, interactive loop, where a team of specialist agents iteratively queries the patient system, integrates new information, and dynamically adapts its composition and strategy. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of DynamiCare through extensive experiments, establishing the first benchmark for dynamic clinical decision-making with LLM-powered agents."}
{"title":"Evaluating Structured Output Robustness of Small Language Models for Open Attribute-Value Extraction from Clinical Notes","abstract":"We present a comparative analysis of the parseability of structured outputs generated by small language models for open attribute-value extraction from clinical notes. We evaluate three widely used serialization formats: JSON, YAML, and XML, and find that JSON consistently yields the highest parseability. Structural robustness improves with targeted prompting and larger models, but declines for longer documents and certain note types. Our error analysis identifies recurring format-specific failure patterns. These findings offer practical guidance for selecting serialization formats and designing prompts when deploying language models in privacy-sensitive clinical settings."}
{"title":"Clinical NLP with Attention-Based Deep Learning for Multi-Disease Prediction","abstract":"This paper addresses the challenges posed by the unstructured nature and high-dimensional semantic complexity of electronic health record texts. A deep learning method based on attention mechanisms is proposed to achieve unified modeling for information extraction and multi-label disease prediction. The study is conducted on the MIMIC-IV dataset. A Transformer-based architecture is used to perform representation learning over clinical text. Multi-layer self-attention mechanisms are employed to capture key medical entities and their contextual relationships. A Sigmoid-based multi-label classifier is then applied to predict multiple disease labels. The model incorporates a context-aware semantic alignment mechanism, enhancing its representational capacity in typical medical scenarios such as label co-occurrence and sparse information. To comprehensively evaluate model performance, a series of experiments were conducted, including baseline comparisons, hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, data perturbation studies, and noise injection tests. Results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms representative existing approaches across multiple performance metrics. The model maintains strong generalization under varying data scales, interference levels, and model depth configurations. The framework developed in this study offers an efficient algorithmic foundation for processing real-world clinical texts and presents practical significance for multi-label medical text modeling tasks."}
{"title":"A Weakly Supervised Transformer for Rare Disease Diagnosis and Subphenotyping from EHRs with Pulmonary Case Studies","abstract":"Rare diseases affect an estimated 300-400 million people worldwide, yet individual conditions remain underdiagnosed and poorly characterized due to their low prevalence and limited clinician familiarity. Computational phenotyping offers a scalable approach to improving rare disease detection, but algorithm development is hindered by the scarcity of high-quality labeled data for training. Expert-labeled datasets from chart reviews and registries are clinically accurate but limited in scope and availability, whereas labels derived from electronic health records (EHRs) provide broader coverage but are often noisy or incomplete. To address these challenges, we propose WEST (WEakly Supervised Transformer for rare disease phenotyping and subphenotyping from EHRs), a framework that combines routinely collected EHR data with a limited set of expert-validated cases and controls to enable large-scale phenotyping. At its core, WEST employs a weakly supervised transformer model trained on extensive probabilistic silver-standard labels - derived from both structured and unstructured EHR features - that are iteratively refined during training to improve model calibration. We evaluate WEST on two rare pulmonary diseases using EHR data from Boston Children's Hospital and show that it outperforms existing methods in phenotype classification, identification of clinically meaningful subphenotypes, and prediction of disease progression. By reducing reliance on manual annotation, WEST enables data-efficient rare disease phenotyping that improves cohort definition, supports earlier and more accurate diagnosis, and accelerates data-driven discovery for the rare disease community."}
{"title":"clustra: A multi-platform k-means clustering algorithm for analysis of longitudinal trajectories in large electronic health records data","abstract":"Background and Objective: Variables collected over time, or longitudinally, such as biologic measurements in electronic health records data, are not simple to summarize with a single time-point, and thus can be more holistically conceptualized as trajectories over time. Cluster analysis with longitudinal data further allows for clinical representation of groups of subjects with similar trajectories and identification of unique characteristics, or phenotypes, that can be investigated as risk factors or disease outcomes. Some of the challenges in estimating these clustered trajectories lie in the handling of observations at inconsistent time intervals and the usability of algorithms across programming languages.\n  Methods: We propose longitudinal trajectory clustering using a k-means algorithm with thin-plate regression splines, implemented across multiple platforms, the R package clustra and corresponding \\SAS macros. The \\SAS macros accommodate flexible clustering approaches, and also include visualization of the clusters, and silhouette plots for diagnostic evaluation of the appropriate cluster number. The R package, designed in parallel, has similar functionality, with additional multi-core processing and Rand-index-based diagnostics.\n  Results: The package and macros achieve comparable results when applied to an example of simulated blood pressure measurements based on real data from Veterans Affairs Healthcare recipients who were initiated on anti-hypertensive medication.\n  Conclusion: The R package clustra and the SAS macros integrate a K-means clustering algorithm for longitudinal trajectories that operates with large electronic health record data. The implementations provide comparable results in both platforms, satisfying the needs of investigators familiar with, or constrained by access to, one or the other platform."}
{"title":"Foundation Models for Clinical Records at Health System Scale","abstract":"Large-scale pretraining has transformed modeling of language and other data types, but its potential remains underexplored in healthcare with structured electronic health records (EHRs). We present a novel generative pretraining strategy for sequential EHR data using next-visit event prediction. Our model learns to autoregressively generate various tokenized clinical events for the next visit based on patient history and inherently handles the joint prediction of heterogeneous data types. Additionally, we introduce regularization on predicting repeated events and highlight a key pitfall in EHR-based foundation model evaluations: repeated event tokens can inflate performance metrics when new onsets are not distinguished from subsequent occurrences. Our model is evaluated via zero-shot prediction for forecasting dementia and knee osteoarthritis incidence within 2 and 5 years, and the model performance rivals a fully fine-tuned masked pretrained Transformer baseline, demonstrating that our approach captures complex clinical dependencies without requiring costly task-specific fine-tuning."}
{"title":"Federated Timeline Synthesis: Scalable and Private Methodology For Model Training and Deployment","abstract":"We present Federated Timeline Synthesis (FTS), a novel framework for training generative foundation models across distributed timeseries data applied to electronic health records (EHR). At its core, FTS represents patient history as tokenized Patient Health Timelines (PHTs), language-agnostic sequences encoding temporal, categorical, and continuous clinical information. Each institution trains an autoregressive transformer on its local PHTs and transmits only model weights to a central server. The server uses the generators to synthesize a large corpus of trajectories and train a Global Generator (GG), enabling zero-shot inference via Monte Carlo simulation of future PHTs. We evaluate FTS on five clinically meaningful prediction tasks using MIMIC-IV data, showing that models trained on synthetic data generated by GG perform comparably to those trained on real data. FTS offers strong privacy guarantees, scalability across institutions, and extensibility to diverse prediction and simulation tasks especially in healthcare, including counterfactual inference, early warning detection, and synthetic trial design."}
{"title":"Ensemble BERT for Medication Event Classification on Electronic Health Records (EHRs)","abstract":"Identification of key variables such as medications, diseases, relations from health records and clinical notes has a wide range of applications in the clinical domain. n2c2 2022 provided shared tasks on challenges in natural language processing for clinical data analytics on electronic health records (EHR), where it built a comprehensive annotated clinical data Contextualized Medication Event Dataset (CMED). This study focuses on subtask 2 in Track 1 of this challenge that is to detect and classify medication events from clinical notes through building a novel BERT-based ensemble model. It started with pretraining BERT models on different types of big data such as Wikipedia and MIMIC. Afterwards, these pretrained BERT models were fine-tuned on CMED training data. These fine-tuned BERT models were employed to accomplish medication event classification on CMED testing data with multiple predictions. These multiple predictions generated by these fine-tuned BERT models were integrated to build final prediction with voting strategies. Experimental results demonstrated that BERT-based ensemble models can effectively improve strict Micro-F score by about 5% and strict Macro-F score by about 6%, respectively."}
{"title":"Conversational LLMs Simplify Secure Clinical Data Access, Understanding, and Analysis","abstract":"Large-scale clinical databases offer opportunities for medical research, but their complexity creates barriers to effective use. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC-IV), one of the world's largest open-source electronic health record databases, traditionally requires both SQL proficiency and clinical domain expertise. We introduce M3, a system that enables natural language querying of MIMIC-IV data through the Model Context Protocol. With a single command, M3 retrieves MIMIC-IV from PhysioNet, launches a local SQLite instance or connects to hosted BigQuery, and allows researchers to pose clinical questions in plain English. We evaluated M3 using one hundred questions from the EHRSQL 2024 benchmark with two language models: the proprietary Claude Sonnet 4 achieved 94% accuracy, while the open-source gpt-oss-20B (deployable locally on consumer hardware) achieved 93% accuracy. Both models translate natural language into SQL, execute queries against MIMIC-IV, and return structured results alongside the underlying query for verification. Error analysis revealed that most failures stemmed from complex temporal reasoning or ambiguous question phrasing rather than fundamental architectural limitations. The comparable performance of a smaller open-source model demonstrates that privacy-preserving local deployment is viable for sensitive clinical data analysis. M3 lowers technical barriers to critical care data analysis while maintaining security through OAuth2 authentication, query validation, and comprehensive audit logging."}
{"title":"Characterization Of Diseases In Temporal Comorbidity Networks","abstract":"Comorbidity networks, which capture disease-disease co-occurrence usually based on electronic health records, reveal structured patterns in how diseases cluster and progress across individuals. However, how these networks evolve across different age groups and how this evolution relates to properties like disease prevalence and mortality remains understudied. To address these issues, we used publicly available comorbidity networks extracted from a comprehensive dataset of 45 million Austrian hospital stays from 1997 to 2014, covering 8.9 million patients. These networks grow and become denser with age. We identified groups of diseases that exhibit similar patterns of structural centrality throughout the lifespan, revealing three dominant age-related components with peaks in early childhood, midlife, and late life. To uncover the drivers of this structural change, we examined the relationship between prevalence and degree. This allowed us to identify conditions that were disproportionately connected to other diseases. Using betweenness centrality in combination with mortality data, we further identified high-mortality bridging diseases. Several diseases show high connectivity relative to their prevalence, such as iron deficiency anemia (D50) in children, nicotine dependence (F17), and lipoprotein metabolism disorders (E78) in adults. We also highlight structurally central diseases with high mortality that emerge at different life stages, including cancers (C group), liver cirrhosis (K74), subarachnoid hemorrhage (I60), and chronic kidney disease (N18). These findings underscore the importance of targeting age-specific, network-central conditions with high mortality for prevention and integrated care."}
{"title":"Red Teaming for Generative AI, Report on a Copyright-Focused Exercise Completed in an Academic Medical Center","abstract":"Background: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) deployment in academic medical settings raises copyright compliance concerns. Dana-Farber Cancer Institute implemented GPT4DFCI, an internal generative AI tool utilizing OpenAI models, that is approved for enterprise use in research and operations. Given (1) the exceptionally broad adoption of the tool in our organization, (2) our research mission, and (3) the shared responsibility model required to benefit from Customer Copyright Commitment in Azure OpenAI Service products, we deemed rigorous copyright compliance testing necessary.\n  Case Description: We conducted a structured red teaming exercise in Nov. 2024, with 42 participants from academic, industry, and government institutions. Four teams attempted to extract copyrighted content from GPT4DFCI across four domains: literary works, news articles, scientific publications, and access-restricted clinical notes. Teams successfully extracted verbatim book dedications and near-exact passages through various strategies. News article extraction failed despite jailbreak attempts. Scientific article reproduction yielded only high-level summaries. Clinical note testing revealed appropriate privacy safeguards.\n  Discussion: The successful extraction of literary content indicates potential copyrighted material presence in training data, necessitating inference-time filtering. Differential success rates across content types suggest varying protective mechanisms. The event led to implementation of a copyright-specific meta-prompt in GPT4DFCI; this mitigation has been in production since Jan. 2025.\n  Conclusion: Systematic red teaming revealed specific vulnerabilities in generative AI copyright compliance, leading to concrete mitigation strategies. Academic medical institutions deploying generative AI should implement continuous testing protocols to ensure legal and ethical compliance."}
{"title":"Efficient Estimation of Causal Effects Under Two-Phase Sampling with Error-Prone Outcome and Treatment Measurements","abstract":"Measurement error is a common challenge for causal inference studies using electronic health record (EHR) data, where clinical outcomes and treatments are frequently mismeasured. Researchers often address measurement error by conducting manual chart reviews to validate measurements in a subset of the full EHR data -- a form of two-phase sampling. To improve efficiency, phase-two samples are often collected in a biased manner dependent on the patients' initial, error-prone measurements. In this work, motivated by our aim of performing causal inference with error-prone outcome and treatment measurements under two-phase sampling, we develop solutions applicable to both this specific problem and the broader problem of causal inference with two-phase samples. For our specific measurement error problem, we construct two asymptotically equivalent doubly-robust estimators of the average treatment effect and demonstrate how these estimators arise from two previously disconnected approaches to constructing efficient estimators in general two-phase sampling settings. We document various sources of instability affecting estimators from each approach and propose modifications that can considerably improve finite sample performance in any two-phase sampling context. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed methods through simulation studies and an illustrative example assessing effects of antiretroviral therapy on occurrence of AIDS-defining events in patients with HIV from the Vanderbilt Comprehensive Care Clinic."}
{"title":"Cohort Retrieval using Dense Passage Retrieval","abstract":"Patient cohort retrieval is a pivotal task in medical research and clinical practice, enabling the identification of specific patient groups from extensive electronic health records (EHRs). In this work, we address the challenge of cohort retrieval in the echocardiography domain by applying Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR), a prominent methodology in semantic search. We propose a systematic approach to transform an echocardiographic EHR dataset of unstructured nature into a Query-Passage dataset, framing the problem as a Cohort Retrieval task. Additionally, we design and implement evaluation metrics inspired by real-world clinical scenarios to rigorously test the models across diverse retrieval tasks. Furthermore, we present a custom-trained DPR embedding model that demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional and off-the-shelf SOTA methods.To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply DPR for patient cohort retrieval in the echocardiography domain, establishing a framework that can be adapted to other medical domains."}
{"title":"DiaLLMs: EHR Enhanced Clinical Conversational System for Clinical Test Recommendation and Diagnosis Prediction","abstract":"Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to remarkable progresses in medical consultation. However, existing medical LLMs overlook the essential role of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and focus primarily on diagnosis recommendation, limiting their clinical applicability. We propose DiaLLM, the first medical LLM that integrates heterogeneous EHR data into clinically grounded dialogues, enabling clinical test recommendation, result interpretation, and diagnosis prediction to better align with real-world medical practice. To construct clinically grounded dialogues from EHR, we design a Clinical Test Reference (CTR) strategy that maps each clinical code to its corresponding description and classifies test results as \"normal\" or \"abnormal\". Additionally, DiaLLM employs a reinforcement learning framework for evidence acquisition and automated diagnosis. To handle the large action space, we introduce a reject sampling strategy to reduce redundancy and improve exploration efficiency. Furthermore, a confirmation reward and a class-sensitive diagnosis reward are designed to guide accurate diagnosis prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that DiaLLM outperforms baselines in clinical test recommendation and diagnosis prediction."}

We explored various components of a RAG framework, focusing on ranked list truncation (RLT) retrieval strategies and attribution approaches. Instead of using a fixed top-k RLT retrieval strategy, we employ a query-dependent-k retrieval strategy, including the existing surprise and autocut methods and two new methods proposed in this work, autocut* and elbow.

{"title":"Refine Medical Diagnosis Using Generation Augmented Retrieval and Clinical Practice Guidelines","abstract":"Current medical language models, adapted from large language models (LLMs), typically predict ICD code-based diagnosis from electronic health records (EHRs) because these labels are readily available. However, ICD codes do not capture the nuanced, context-rich reasoning clinicians use for diagnosis. Clinicians synthesize diverse patient data and reference clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to make evidence-based decisions. This misalignment limits the clinical utility of existing models. We introduce GARMLE-G, a Generation-Augmented Retrieval framework that grounds medical language model outputs in authoritative CPGs. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation based approaches, GARMLE-G enables hallucination-free outputs by directly retrieving authoritative guideline content without relying on model-generated text. It (1) integrates LLM predictions with EHR data to create semantically rich queries, (2) retrieves relevant CPG knowledge snippets via embedding similarity, and (3) fuses guideline content with model output to generate clinically aligned recommendations. A prototype system for hypertension diagnosis was developed and evaluated on multiple metrics, demonstrating superior retrieval precision, semantic relevance, and clinical guideline adherence compared to RAG-based baselines, while maintaining a lightweight architecture suitable for localized healthcare deployment. This work provides a scalable, low-cost, and hallucination-free method for grounding medical language models in evidence-based clinical practice, with strong potential for broader clinical deployment."}
{"title":"THCM-CAL: Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Modelling with Conformal Calibration for Clinical Risk Prediction","abstract":"Automated clinical risk prediction from electronic health records (EHRs) demands modeling both structured diagnostic codes and unstructured narrative notes. However, most prior approaches either handle these modalities separately or rely on simplistic fusion strategies that ignore the directional, hierarchical causal interactions by which narrative observations precipitate diagnoses and propagate risk across admissions. In this paper, we propose THCM-CAL, a Temporal-Hierarchical Causal Model with Conformal Calibration. Our framework constructs a multimodal causal graph where nodes represent clinical entities from two modalities: Textual propositions extracted from notes and ICD codes mapped to textual descriptions. Through hierarchical causal discovery, THCM-CAL infers three clinically grounded interactions: intra-slice same-modality sequencing, intra-slice cross-modality triggers, and inter-slice risk propagation. To enhance prediction reliability, we extend conformal prediction to multi-label ICD coding, calibrating per-code confidence intervals under complex co-occurrences. Experimental results on MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV demonstrate the superiority of THCM-CAL."}
{"title":"DistillNote: LLM-based clinical note summaries improve heart failure diagnosis","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to generate concise summaries of patient information and alleviate the burden of clinical documentation that overwhelms healthcare providers. We present Distillnote, a framework for LLM-based clinical note summarization, and generate over 64,000 admission note summaries through three techniques: (1) One-step, direct summarization, and a divide-and-conquer approach involving (2) Structured summarization focused on independent clinical insights, and (3) Distilled summarization that further condenses the Structured summaries. We test how useful are the summaries by using them to predict heart failure compared to a model trained on the original notes. Distilled summaries achieve 79% text compression and up to 18.2% improvement in AUPRC compared to an LLM trained on the full notes. We also evaluate the quality of the generated summaries in an LLM-as-judge evaluation as well as through blinded pairwise comparisons with clinicians. Evaluations indicate that one-step summaries are favoured by clinicians according to relevance and clinical actionability, while distilled summaries offer optimal efficiency (avg. 6.9x compression-to-performance ratio) and significantly reduce hallucinations. We release our summaries on PhysioNet to encourage future research."}
{"title":"Initial Investigation of LLM-Assisted Development of Rule-Based Clinical NLP System","abstract":"Despite advances in machine learning (ML) and large language models (LLMs), rule-based natural language processing (NLP) systems remain active in clinical settings due to their interpretability and operational efficiency. However, their manual development and maintenance are labor-intensive, particularly in tasks with large linguistic variability. To overcome these limitations, we proposed a novel approach employing LLMs solely during the rule-based systems development phase. We conducted the initial experiments focusing on the first two steps of developing a rule-based NLP pipeline: find relevant snippets from the clinical note; extract informative keywords from the snippets for the rule-based named entity recognition (NER) component. Our experiments demonstrated exceptional recall in identifying clinically relevant text snippets (Deepseek: 0.98, Qwen: 0.99) and 1.0 in extracting key terms for NER. This study sheds light on a promising new direction for NLP development, enabling semi-automated or automated development of rule-based systems with significantly faster, more cost-effective, and transparent execution compared with deep learning model-based solutions."}
{"title":"DeepJ: Graph Convolutional Transformers with Differentiable Pooling for Patient Trajectory Modeling","abstract":"In recent years, graph learning has gained significant interest for modeling complex interactions among medical events in structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. However, existing graph-based approaches often work in a static manner, either restricting interactions within individual encounters or collapsing all historical encounters into a single snapshot. As a result, when it is necessary to identify meaningful groups of medical events spanning longitudinal encounters, existing methods are inadequate in modeling interactions cross encounters while accounting for temporal dependencies. To address this limitation, we introduce Deep Patient Journey (DeepJ), a novel graph convolutional transformer model with differentiable graph pooling to effectively capture intra-encounter and inter-encounter medical event interactions. DeepJ can identify groups of temporally and functionally related medical events, offering valuable insights into key event clusters pertinent to patient outcome prediction. DeepJ significantly outperformed five state-of-the-art baseline models while enhancing interpretability, demonstrating its potential for improved patient risk stratification."}
{"title":"CKD-EHR:Clinical Knowledge Distillation for Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHR)-based disease prediction models have demonstrated significant clinical value in promoting precision medicine and enabling early intervention. However, existing large language models face two major challenges: insufficient representation of medical knowledge and low efficiency in clinical deployment. To address these challenges, this study proposes the CKD-EHR (Clinical Knowledge Distillation for EHR) framework, which achieves efficient and accurate disease risk prediction through knowledge distillation techniques. Specifically, the large language model Qwen2.5-7B is first fine-tuned on medical knowledge-enhanced data to serve as the teacher model.It then generates interpretable soft labels through a multi-granularity attention distillation mechanism. Finally, the distilled knowledge is transferred to a lightweight BERT student model. Experimental results show that on the MIMIC-III dataset, CKD-EHR significantly outperforms the baseline model:diagnostic accuracy is increased by 9%, F1-score is improved by 27%, and a 22.2 times inference speedup is achieved. This innovative solution not only greatly improves resource utilization efficiency but also significantly enhances the accuracy and timeliness of diagnosis, providing a practical technical approach for resource optimization in clinical settings.

{"title":"Integrating Knowledge Graphs and Bayesian Networks: A Hybrid Approach for Explainable Disease Risk Prediction","abstract":"Multimodal electronic health record (EHR) data is useful for disease risk prediction based on medical domain knowledge. However, general medical knowledge must be adapted to specific healthcare settings and patient populations to achieve practical clinical use. Additionally, risk prediction systems must handle uncertainty from incomplete data and non-deterministic health outcomes while remaining explainable. These challenges can be alleviated by the integration of knowledge graphs (KGs) and Bayesian networks (BNs). We present a novel approach for constructing BNs from ontology-based KGs and multimodal EHR data for explainable disease risk prediction. Through an application use case of atrial fibrillation and real-world EHR data, we demonstrate that the approach balances generalised medical knowledge with patient-specific context, effectively handles uncertainty, is highly explainable, and achieves good predictive performance."}
{"title":"Bias Delayed is Bias Denied? Assessing the Effect of Reporting Delays on Disparity Assessments","abstract":"Conducting disparity assessments at regular time intervals is critical for surfacing potential biases in decision-making and improving outcomes across demographic groups. Because disparity assessments fundamentally depend on the availability of demographic information, their efficacy is limited by the availability and consistency of available demographic identifiers. While prior work has considered the impact of missing data on fairness, little attention has been paid to the role of delayed demographic data. Delayed data, while eventually observed, might be missing at the critical point of monitoring and action -- and delays may be unequally distributed across groups in ways that distort disparity assessments. We characterize such impacts in healthcare, using electronic health records of over 5M patients across primary care practices in all 50 states. Our contributions are threefold. First, we document the high rate of race and ethnicity reporting delays in a healthcare setting and demonstrate widespread variation in rates at which demographics are reported across different groups. Second, through a set of retrospective analyses using real data, we find that such delays impact disparity assessments and hence conclusions made across a range of consequential healthcare outcomes, particularly at more granular levels of state-level and practice-level assessments. Third, we find limited ability of conventional methods that impute missing race in mitigating the effects of reporting delays on the accuracy of timely disparity assessments. Our insights and methods generalize to many domains of algorithmic fairness where delays in the availability of sensitive information may confound audits, thus deserving closer attention within a pipeline-aware machine learning framework."}
{"title":"Equitable Electronic Health Record Prediction with FAME: Fairness-Aware Multimodal Embedding","abstract":"Electronic Health Record (EHR) data encompass diverse modalities -- text, images, and medical codes -- that are vital for clinical decision-making. To process these complex data, multimodal AI (MAI) has emerged as a powerful approach for fusing such information. However, most existing MAI models optimize for better prediction performance, potentially reinforcing biases across patient subgroups. Although bias-reduction techniques for multimodal models have been proposed, the individual strengths of each modality and their interplay in both reducing bias and optimizing performance remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce FAME (Fairness-Aware Multimodal Embeddings), a framework that explicitly weights each modality according to its fairness contribution. FAME optimizes both performance and fairness by incorporating a combined loss function. We leverage the Error Distribution Disparity Index (EDDI) to measure fairness across subgroups and propose a sign-agnostic aggregation method to balance fairness across subgroups, ensuring equitable model outcomes. We evaluate FAME with BEHRT and BioClinicalBERT, combining structured and unstructured EHR data, and demonstrate its effectiveness in terms of performance and fairness compared with other baselines across multiple EHR prediction tasks."}
{"title":"A simplified and robust proxy-based approach for overcoming unmeasured confounding in EHR studies","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHR) are used to study treatment effects in clinical settings, yet unmeasured confounding remains a persistent challenge. Indirect measurements of the unmeasured confounder (proxies) offer a potential solution, but existing approaches -- such as proximal inference or full joint modeling -- can be difficult to implement. We propose a two-stage, proxy-based method that is practical, broadly applicable, and robust. In the first stage, we apply factor analysis to proxy and treatment variables, extracting information on latent factors that serve as a surrogate for the unmeasured confounder. In the second stage, we use this model to build covariates that improve causal effect estimation in a standard outcome regression model. Through simulations, we test the method's performance under assumption violations, including non-normal errors, model misspecification, and scenarios where instruments or confounders are incorrectly treated as proxies. We also apply the method to estimate the effect of hospital admission for older adults presenting to the emergency department with chest pain, a setting where standard analyses may fail to recover plausible effects. Our results show that this simplified strategy recovers more reliable estimates than conventional adjustment methods, offering applied researchers a practical tool for addressing unmeasured confounding with proxy variables."}
{"title":"Converting Annotated Clinical Cases into Structured Case Report Forms","abstract":"Case Report Forms (CRFs) are largely used in medical research as they ensure accuracy, reliability, and validity of results in clinical studies. However, publicly available, wellannotated CRF datasets are scarce, limiting the development of CRF slot filling systems able to fill in a CRF from clinical notes. To mitigate the scarcity of CRF datasets, we propose to take advantage of available datasets annotated for information extraction tasks and to convert them into structured CRFs. We present a semi-automatic conversion methodology, which has been applied to the E3C dataset in two languages (English and Italian), resulting in a new, high-quality dataset for CRF slot filling. Through several experiments on the created dataset, we report that slot filling achieves 59.7% for Italian and 67.3% for English on a closed Large Language Models (zero-shot) and worse performances on three families of open-source models, showing that filling CRFs is challenging even for recent state-of-the-art LLMs. We release the datest at https:\/\/huggingface.co\/collections\/NLP-FBK\/e3c-to-crf-67b9844065460cbe42f80166"}
{"title":"Enhancing Clinical Decision Support and EHR Insights through LLMs and the Model Context Protocol: An Open-Source MCP-FHIR Framework","abstract":"Enhancing clinical decision support (CDS), reducing documentation burdens, and improving patient health literacy remain persistent challenges in digital health. This paper presents an open-source, agent-based framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with HL7 FHIR data via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for dynamic extraction and reasoning over electronic health records (EHRs). Built on the established MCP-FHIR implementation, the framework enables declarative access to diverse FHIR resources through JSON-based configurations, supporting real-time summarization, interpretation, and personalized communication across multiple user personas, including clinicians, caregivers, and patients. To ensure privacy and reproducibility, the framework is evaluated using synthetic EHR data from the SMART Health IT sandbox (https:\/\/r4.smarthealthit.org\/), which conforms to the FHIR R4 standard. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on hardcoded retrieval and static workflows, the proposed method delivers scalable, explainable, and interoperable AI-powered EHR applications. The agentic architecture further supports multiple FHIR formats, laying a robust foundation for advancing personalized digital health solutions."}
{"title":"Neural at ArchEHR-QA 2025: Agentic Prompt Optimization for Evidence-Grounded Clinical Question Answering","abstract":"Automated question answering (QA) over electronic health records (EHRs) can bridge critical information gaps for clinicians and patients, yet it demands both precise evidence retrieval and faithful answer generation under limited supervision. In this work, we present Neural, the runner-up in the BioNLP 2025 ArchEHR-QA shared task on evidence-grounded clinical QA. Our proposed method decouples the task into (1) sentence-level evidence identification and (2) answer synthesis with explicit citations. For each stage, we automatically explore the prompt space with DSPy's MIPROv2 optimizer, jointly tuning instructions and few-shot demonstrations on the development set. A self-consistency voting scheme further improves evidence recall without sacrificing precision. On the hidden test set, our method attains an overall score of 51.5, placing second stage while outperforming standard zero-shot and few-shot prompting by over 20 and 10 points, respectively. These results indicate that data-driven prompt optimization is a cost-effective alternative to model fine-tuning for high-stakes clinical QA, advancing the reliability of AI assistants in healthcare."}
{"title":"A Topic Modeling Analysis of Stigma Dimensions, Social, and Related Behavioral Circumstances in Clinical Notes Among Patients with HIV","abstract":"Objective: To characterize stigma dimensions, social, and related behavioral circumstances in people living with HIV(PLWHs) seeking care, using NLP methods applied to a large collection of EHR clinical notes from a large integrated health system in the southeast United States. Methods: We identified a cohort of PLWHs from the UF Health IDR and performed topic modeling analysis using Latent Dirichlet Allocation to uncover stigma-related dimensions and related social and behavioral contexts. Domain experts created a seed list of HIV-related stigma keywords, then applied a snowball strategy to review notes for additional terms until saturation was reached iteratively. To identify more target topics, we tested three keyword-based filtering strategies. The detected topics were evaluated using three widely used metrics and manually reviewed by specialists. In addition, we conducted word frequency analysis and topic variation analysis among subgroups to examine differences across age and sex-specific demographics. Results: We identified 9140 PLWHs at UF Health and collected 2.9 million clinical notes. Through the iterative keyword approach, we generated a list of 91 keywords associated with HIV-related stigma. Topic modeling on sentences containing at least one keyword uncovered a wide range of topic themes, such as \"Mental Health Concern, Stigma\", \"Treatment Refusal, Isolation\", and \"Substance Abuse\". Topic variation analysis across age subgroups revealed substantial differences. Conclusion: Extracting and understanding the HIV-related stigma and associated social and behavioral circumstances from EHR clinical notes enables scalable, time-efficient assessment and overcoming the limitations of traditional questionnaires. Findings from this research provide actionable insights to inform patient care and interventions to improve HIV-care outcomes."}
{"title":"Scalable Medication Extraction and Discontinuation Identification from Electronic Health Records Using Large Language Models","abstract":"Identifying medication discontinuations in electronic health records (EHRs) is vital for patient safety but is often hindered by information being buried in unstructured notes. This study aims to evaluate the capabilities of advanced open-sourced and proprietary large language models (LLMs) in extracting medications and classifying their medication status from EHR notes, focusing on their scalability on medication information extraction without human annotation. We collected three EHR datasets from diverse sources to build the evaluation benchmark. We evaluated 12 advanced LLMs and explored multiple LLM prompting strategies. Performance on medication extraction, medication status classification, and their joint task (extraction then classification) was systematically compared across all experiments. We found that LLMs showed promising performance on the medication extraction and discontinuation classification from EHR notes. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest average F1 scores in all tasks under zero-shot setting - 94.0% for medication extraction, 78.1% for discontinuation classification, and 72.7% for the joint task. Open-sourced models followed closely, Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct achieved the highest performance in medication status classification on the MIV-Med dataset (68.7%) and in the joint task on both the Re-CASI (76.2%) and MIV-Med (60.2%) datasets. Medical-specific LLMs demonstrated lower performance compared to advanced general-domain LLMs. Few-shot learning generally improved performance, while CoT reasoning showed inconsistent gains. LLMs demonstrate strong potential for medication extraction and discontinuation identification on EHR notes, with open-sourced models offering scalable alternatives to proprietary systems and few-shot can further improve LLMs' capability."}
{"title":"Integrated Analysis for Electronic Health Records with Structured and Sporadic Missingness","abstract":"Objectives: We propose a novel imputation method tailored for Electronic Health Records (EHRs) with structured and sporadic missingness. Such missingness frequently arises in the integration of heterogeneous EHR datasets for downstream clinical applications. By addressing these gaps, our method provides a practical solution for integrated analysis, enhancing data utility and advancing the understanding of population health.\n  Materials and Methods: We begin by demonstrating structured and sporadic missing mechanisms in the integrated analysis of EHR data. Following this, we introduce a novel imputation framework, Macomss, specifically designed to handle structurally and heterogeneously occurring missing data. We establish theoretical guarantees for Macomss, ensuring its robustness in preserving the integrity and reliability of integrated analyses. To assess its empirical performance, we conduct extensive simulation studies that replicate the complex missingness patterns observed in real-world EHR systems, complemented by validation using EHR datasets from the Duke University Health System (DUHS).\n  Results: Simulation studies show that our approach consistently outperforms existing imputation methods. Using datasets from three hospitals within DUHS, Macomss achieves the lowest imputation errors for missing data in most cases and provides superior or comparable downstream prediction performance compared to benchmark methods.\n  Conclusions: We provide a theoretically guaranteed and practically meaningful method for imputing structured and sporadic missing data, enabling accurate and reliable integrated analysis across multiple EHR datasets. The proposed approach holds significant potential for advancing research in population health."}
{"title":"TRACE: Grounding Time Series in Context for Multimodal Embedding and Retrieval","abstract":"The ubiquity of dynamic data in domains such as weather, healthcare, and energy underscores a growing need for effective interpretation and retrieval of time-series data. These data are inherently tied to domain-specific contexts, such as clinical notes or weather narratives, making cross-modal retrieval essential not only for downstream tasks but also for developing robust time-series foundation models by retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Despite the increasing demand, time-series retrieval remains largely underexplored. Existing methods often lack semantic grounding, struggle to align heterogeneous modalities, and have limited capacity for handling multi-channel signals. To address this gap, we propose TRACE, a generic multimodal retriever that grounds time-series embeddings in aligned textual context. TRACE enables fine-grained channel-level alignment and employs hard negative mining to facilitate semantically meaningful retrieval. It supports flexible cross-modal retrieval modes, including Text-to-Timeseries and Timeseries-to-Text, effectively linking linguistic descriptions with complex temporal patterns. By retrieving semantically relevant pairs, TRACE enriches downstream models with informative context, leading to improved predictive accuracy and interpretability. Beyond a static retrieval engine, TRACE also serves as a powerful standalone encoder, with lightweight task-specific tuning that refines context-aware representations while maintaining strong cross-modal alignment. These representations achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream forecasting and classification tasks. Extensive experiments across multiple domains highlight its dual utility, as both an effective encoder for downstream applications and a general-purpose retriever to enhance time-series models."}
{"title":"Ensuring Reliability of Curated EHR-Derived Data: The Validation of Accuracy for LLM\/ML-Extracted Information and Data (VALID) Framework","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to extract clinical data from electronic health records (EHRs), offering significant improvements in scalability and efficiency for real-world data (RWD) curation in oncology. However, the adoption of LLMs introduces new challenges in ensuring the reliability, accuracy, and fairness of extracted data, which are essential for research, regulatory, and clinical applications. Existing quality assurance frameworks for RWD and artificial intelligence do not fully address the unique error modes and complexities associated with LLM-extracted data. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of clinical data extracted by LLMs. The framework integrates variable-level performance benchmarking against expert human abstraction, automated verification checks for internal consistency and plausibility, and replication analyses comparing LLM-extracted data to human-abstracted datasets or external standards. This multidimensional approach enables the identification of variables most in need of improvement, systematic detection of latent errors, and confirmation of dataset fitness-for-purpose in real-world research. Additionally, the framework supports bias assessment by stratifying metrics across demographic subgroups. By providing a rigorous and transparent method for assessing LLM-extracted RWD, this framework advances industry standards and supports the trustworthy use of AI-powered evidence generation in oncology research and practice."}
{"title":"Comparing methods for handling missing data in electronic health records for dynamic risk prediction of central-line associated bloodstream infection","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHR) often contain varying levels of missing data. This study compared different imputation strategies to identify the most suitable approach for predicting central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) in the presence of competing risks using EHR data. We analyzed 30862 catheter episodes at University Hospitals Leuven (2012-2013) to predict 7-day CLABSI risk using a landmark cause-specific supermodel, accounting for competing risks of hospital discharge and death. Imputation methods included simple methods (median\/mode, last observation carried forward), multiple imputation, regression-based and mixed-effects models leveraging longitudinal structure, and random forest imputation to capture interactions and non-linearities. Missing indicators were also assessed alone and in combination with other imputation methods. Model performance was evaluated dynamically at daily landmarks up to 14 days post-catheter placement. The missing indicator approach showed the highest discriminative ability, achieving a mean AUROC of up to 0.782 and superior overall performance based on the scaled Brier score. Combining missing indicators with other methods slightly improved performance, with the mixed model approach combined with missing indicators achieving the highest AUROC (0.783) at day 4, and the missForestPredict approach combined with missing indicators yielding the best scaled Brier scores at earlier landmarks. This suggests that in EHR data, the presence or absence of information may hold valuable insights for patient risk prediction. However, the use of missing indicators requires caution, as shifts in EHR data over time can alter missing data patterns, potentially impacting model transportability."}
{"title":"SAFER: A Calibrated Risk-Aware Multimodal Recommendation Model for Dynamic Treatment Regimes","abstract":"Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) are critical to precision medicine, optimizing long-term outcomes through personalized, real-time decision-making in evolving clinical contexts, but require careful supervision for unsafe treatment risks. Existing efforts rely primarily on clinician-prescribed gold standards despite the absence of a known optimal strategy, and predominantly using structured EHR data without extracting valuable insights from clinical notes, limiting their reliability for treatment recommendations. In this work, we introduce SAFER, a calibrated risk-aware tabular-language recommendation framework for DTR that integrates both structured EHR and clinical notes, enabling them to learn from each other, and addresses inherent label uncertainty by assuming ambiguous optimal treatment solution for deceased patients. Moreover, SAFER employs conformal prediction to provide statistical guarantees, ensuring safe treatment recommendations while filtering out uncertain predictions. Experiments on two publicly available sepsis datasets demonstrate that SAFER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple recommendation metrics and counterfactual mortality rate, while offering robust formal assurances. These findings underscore SAFER potential as a trustworthy and theoretically grounded solution for high-stakes DTR applications."}
{"title":"ICU-TSB: A Benchmark for Temporal Patient Representation Learning for Unsupervised Stratification into Patient Cohorts","abstract":"Patient stratification identifying clinically meaningful subgroups is essential for advancing personalized medicine through improved diagnostics and treatment strategies. Electronic health records (EHRs), particularly those from intensive care units (ICUs), contain rich temporal clinical data that can be leveraged for this purpose. In this work, we introduce ICU-TSB (Temporal Stratification Benchmark), the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating patient stratification based on temporal patient representation learning using three publicly available ICU EHR datasets. A key contribution of our benchmark is a novel hierarchical evaluation framework utilizing disease taxonomies to measure the alignment of discovered clusters with clinically validated disease groupings. In our experiments with ICU-TSB, we compared statistical methods and several recurrent neural networks, including LSTM and GRU, for their ability to generate effective patient representations for subsequent clustering of patient trajectories. Our results demonstrate that temporal representation learning can rediscover clinically meaningful patient cohorts; nevertheless, it remains a challenging task, with v-measuring varying from up to 0.46 at the top level of the taxonomy to up to 0.40 at the lowest level. To further enhance the practical utility of our findings, we also evaluate multiple strategies for assigning interpretable labels to the identified clusters. The experiments and benchmark are fully reproducible and available at https:\/\/github.com\/ds4dh\/CBMS2025stratification."}
{"title":"BioMol-MQA: A Multi-Modal Question Answering Dataset For LLM Reasoning Over Bio-Molecular Interactions","abstract":"Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has shown great power in improving Large Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing RAG-based LLMs are dedicated to retrieving single modality information, mainly text; while for many real-world problems, such as healthcare, information relevant to queries can manifest in various modalities such as knowledge graph, text (clinical notes), and complex molecular structure. Thus, being able to retrieve relevant multi-modality domain-specific information, and reason and synthesize diverse knowledge to generate an accurate response is important. To address the gap, we present BioMol-MQA, a new question-answering (QA) dataset on polypharmacy, which is composed of two parts (i) a multimodal knowledge graph (KG) with text and molecular structure for information retrieval; and (ii) challenging questions that designed to test LLM capabilities in retrieving and reasoning over multimodal KG to answer questions. Our benchmarks indicate that existing LLMs struggle to answer these questions and do well only when given the necessary background data, signaling the necessity for strong RAG frameworks."}
{"title":"UTSA-NLP at ArchEHR-QA 2025: Improving EHR Question Answering via Self-Consistency Prompting","abstract":"We describe our system for the ArchEHR-QA Shared Task on answering clinical questions using electronic health records (EHRs). Our approach uses large language models in two steps: first, to find sentences in the EHR relevant to a clinician's question, and second, to generate a short, citation-supported response based on those sentences. We use few-shot prompting, self-consistency, and thresholding to improve the sentence classification step to decide which sentences are essential. We compare several models and find that a smaller 8B model performs better than a larger 70B model for identifying relevant information. Our results show that accurate sentence selection is critical for generating high-quality responses and that self-consistency with thresholding helps make these decisions more reliable."}
{"title":"From EHRs to Patient Pathways: Scalable Modeling of Longitudinal Health Trajectories with LLMs","abstract":"Healthcare systems face significant challenges in managing and interpreting vast, heterogeneous patient data for personalized care. Existing approaches often focus on narrow use cases with a limited feature space, overlooking the complex, longitudinal interactions needed for a holistic understanding of patient health. In this work, we propose a novel approach to patient pathway modeling by transforming diverse electronic health record (EHR) data into a structured representation and designing a holistic pathway prediction model, EHR2Path, optimized to predict future health trajectories. Further, we introduce a novel summary mechanism that embeds long-term temporal context into topic-specific summary tokens, improving performance over text-only models, while being much more token-efficient. EHR2Path demonstrates strong performance in both next time-step prediction and longitudinal simulation, outperforming competitive baselines. It enables detailed simulations of patient trajectories, inherently targeting diverse evaluation tasks, such as forecasting vital signs, lab test results, or length-of-stay, opening a path towards predictive and personalized healthcare."}
{"title":"A Dataset for Addressing Patient's Information Needs related to Clinical Course of Hospitalization","abstract":"Patients have distinct information needs about their hospitalization that can be addressed using clinical evidence from electronic health records (EHRs). While artificial intelligence (AI) systems show promise in meeting these needs, robust datasets are needed to evaluate the factual accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses. To our knowledge, no existing dataset captures patient information needs in the context of their EHRs. We introduce ArchEHR-QA, an expert-annotated dataset based on real-world patient cases from intensive care unit and emergency department settings. The cases comprise questions posed by patients to public health forums, clinician-interpreted counterparts, relevant clinical note excerpts with sentence-level relevance annotations, and clinician-authored answers. To establish benchmarks for grounded EHR question answering (QA), we evaluated three open-weight large language models (LLMs)--Llama 4, Llama 3, and Mixtral--across three prompting strategies: generating (1) answers with citations to clinical note sentences, (2) answers before citations, and (3) answers from filtered citations. We assessed performance on two dimensions: Factuality (overlap between cited note sentences and ground truth) and Relevance (textual and semantic similarity between system and reference answers). The final dataset contains 134 patient cases. The answer-first prompting approach consistently performed best, with Llama 4 achieving the highest scores. Manual error analysis supported these findings and revealed common issues such as omitted key clinical evidence and contradictory or hallucinated content. Overall, ArchEHR-QA provides a strong benchmark for developing and evaluating patient-centered EHR QA systems, underscoring the need for further progress toward generating factual and relevant responses in clinical contexts."}
{"title":"Leveraging External Data for Testing Experimental Therapies with Biomarker Interactions in Randomized Clinical Trials","abstract":"In oncology the efficacy of novel therapeutics often differs across patient subgroups, and these variations are difficult to predict during the initial phases of the drug development process. The relation between the power of randomized clinical trials and heterogeneous treatment effects has been discussed by several authors. In particular, false negative results are likely to occur when the treatment effects concentrate in a subpopulation but the study design did not account for potential heterogeneous treatment effects. The use of external data from completed clinical studies and electronic health records has the potential to improve decision-making throughout the development of new therapeutics, from early-stage trials to registration. Here we discuss the use of external data to evaluate experimental treatments with potential heterogeneous treatment effects. We introduce a permutation procedure to test, at the completion of a randomized clinical trial, the null hypothesis that the experimental therapy does not improve the primary outcomes in any subpopulation. The permutation test leverages the available external data to increase power. Also, the procedure controls the false positive rate at the desired $\u03b1$-level without restrictive assumptions on the external data, for example, in scenarios with unmeasured confounders, different pre-treatment patient profiles in the trial population compared to the external data, and other discrepancies between the trial and the external data. We illustrate that the permutation test is optimal according to an interpretable criteria and discuss examples based on asymptotic results and simulations, followed by a retrospective analysis of individual patient-level data from a collection of glioblastoma clinical trials."}
{"title":"LLMEval-Med: A Real-world Clinical Benchmark for Medical LLMs with Physician Validation","abstract":"Evaluating large language models (LLMs) in medicine is crucial because medical applications require high accuracy with little room for error. Current medical benchmarks have three main types: medical exam-based, comprehensive medical, and specialized assessments. However, these benchmarks have limitations in question design (mostly multiple-choice), data sources (often not derived from real clinical scenarios), and evaluation methods (poor assessment of complex reasoning). To address these issues, we present LLMEval-Med, a new benchmark covering five core medical areas, including 2,996 questions created from real-world electronic health records and expert-designed clinical scenarios. We also design an automated evaluation pipeline, incorporating expert-developed checklists into our LLM-as-Judge framework. Furthermore, our methodology validates machine scoring through human-machine agreement analysis, dynamically refining checklists and prompts based on expert feedback to ensure reliability. We evaluate 13 LLMs across three categories (specialized medical models, open-source models, and closed-source models) on LLMEval-Med, providing valuable insights for the safe and effective deployment of LLMs in medical domains. The dataset is released in https:\/\/github.com\/llmeval\/LLMEval-Med."}
{"title":"Causal Explainability of Machine Learning in Heart Failure Prediction from Electronic Health Records","abstract":"The importance of clinical variables in the prognosis of the disease is explained using statistical correlation or machine learning (ML). However, the predictive importance of these variables may not represent their causal relationships with diseases. This paper uses clinical variables from a heart failure (HF) patient cohort to investigate the causal explainability of important variables obtained in statistical and ML contexts. Due to inherent regression modeling, popular causal discovery methods strictly assume that the cause and effect variables are numerical and continuous. This paper proposes a new computational framework to enable causal structure discovery (CSD) and score the causal strength of mixed-type (categorical, numerical, binary) clinical variables for binary disease outcomes. In HF classification, we investigate the association between the importance rank order of three feature types: correlated features, features important for ML predictions, and causal features. Our results demonstrate that CSD modeling for nonlinear causal relationships is more meaningful than its linear counterparts. Feature importance obtained from nonlinear classifiers (e.g., gradient-boosting trees) strongly correlates with the causal strength of variables without differentiating cause and effect variables. Correlated variables can be causal for HF, but they are rarely identified as effect variables. These results can be used to add the causal explanation of variables important for ML-based prediction modeling."}
{"title":"Leaps Beyond the Seen: Reinforced Reasoning Augmented Generation for Clinical Notes","abstract":"Clinical note generation aims to produce free-text summaries of a patient's condition and diagnostic process, with discharge instructions being a representative long-form example. While recent LLM-based methods pre-trained on general clinical corpora show promise in clinical text generation, they fall short in producing long-form notes from limited patient information. In this paper, we propose ReinRAG, a reinforced reasoning augmented generation (RAG) for long-form discharge instructions based on pre-admission information. ReinRAG retrieves reasoning paths from a medical knowledge graph to provide explicit semantic guidance to the LLM. To bridge the information gap, we propose group-based retriever optimization (GRO) which improves retrieval quality with group-normalized rewards, encouraging reasoning leaps for deeper inference by the LLM. Comprehensive experiments on the real-world dataset show that ReinRAG outperforms baselines in both clinical efficacy and natural language generation metrics. Further analysis reveals that ReinRAG fills semantic gaps in sparse input scenarios, and retrieved reasoning paths help LLMs avoid clinical misinterpretation by focusing on key evidence and following coherent reasoning."}
{"title":"Decentralized COVID-19 Health System Leveraging Blockchain","abstract":"With the development of the Internet, the amount of data generated by the medical industry each year has grown exponentially. The Electronic Health Record (EHR) manages the electronic data generated during the user's treatment process. Typically, an EHR data manager belongs to a medical institution. This traditional centralized data management model has many unreasonable or inconvenient aspects, such as difficulties in data sharing, and it is hard to verify the authenticity and integrity of the data. The decentralized, non-forgeable, data unalterable and traceable features of blockchain are in line with the application requirements of EHR. This paper takes the most common COVID-19 as the application scenario and designs a COVID-19 health system based on blockchain, which has extensive research and application value. Considering that the public and transparent nature of blockchain violates the privacy requirements of some health data, in the system design stage, from the perspective of practical application, the data is divided into public data and private data according to its characteristics. For private data, data encryption methods are adopted to ensure data privacy. The searchable encryption technology is combined with blockchain technology to achieve the retrieval function of encrypted data. Then, the proxy re-encryption technology is used to realize authorized access to data. In the system implementation part, based on the Hyperledger Fabric architecture, some functions of the system design are realized, including data upload, retrieval of the latest data and historical data. According to the environment provided by the development architecture, Go language chaincode (smart contract) is written to implement the relevant system functions."}

{"title":"A Large Language Model Based Pipeline for Review of Systems Entity Recognition from Clinical Notes","abstract":"Objective: Develop a cost-effective, large language model (LLM)-based pipeline for automatically extracting Review of Systems (ROS) entities from clinical notes. Materials and Methods: The pipeline extracts ROS sections using SecTag, followed by few-shot LLMs to identify ROS entity spans, their positive\/negative status, and associated body systems. We implemented the pipeline using open-source LLMs (Mistral, Llama, Gemma) and ChatGPT. The evaluation was conducted on 36 general medicine notes containing 341 annotated ROS entities. Results: When integrating ChatGPT, the pipeline achieved the lowest error rates in detecting ROS entity spans and their corresponding statuses\/systems (28.2% and 14.5%, respectively). Open-source LLMs enable local, cost-efficient execution of the pipeline while delivering promising performance with similarly low error rates (span: 30.5-36.7%; status\/system: 24.3-27.3%). Discussion and Conclusion: Our pipeline offers a scalable and locally deployable solution to reduce ROS documentation burden. Open-source LLMs present a viable alternative to commercial models in resource-limited healthcare environments."}

While RLVR has succeeded in mathematics and coding, its application to healthcare contexts presents unique challenges due to the specialized knowledge and reasoning required for electronic health record (EHR) interpretation. Our pilot study on the MEDCALC benchmark reveals two key failure modes: (1) misapplied knowledge, where models possess relevant medical knowledge but apply it incorrectly, and (2) missing knowledge, where models lack essential domain knowledge. To address these cases, EHRMIND applies a two-stage solution: a lightweight supervised fine-tuning (SFT) warm-up that injects missing domain knowledge, stabilizes subsequent training, and encourages structured, interpretable outputs; followed by RLVR, which reinforces outcome correctness and refines the model's decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across diverse clinical applications, including medical calculations (MEDCALC), patient-trial matching (TREC CLINICAL TRIALS), and disease diagnosis (EHRSHOT). EHRMIND delivers consistent gains in accuracy, interpretability, and cross-task generalization. These findings offer practical guidance for applying RLVR to enhance LLM capabilities in healthcare settings."}
{"title":"CDR-Agent: Intelligent Selection and Execution of Clinical Decision Rules Using Large Language Model Agents","abstract":"Clinical decision-making is inherently complex and fast-paced, particularly in emergency departments (EDs) where critical, rapid and high-stakes decisions are made. Clinical Decision Rules (CDRs) are standardized evidence-based tools that combine signs, symptoms, and clinical variables into decision trees to make consistent and accurate diagnoses. CDR usage is often hindered by the clinician's cognitive load, limiting their ability to quickly recall and apply the appropriate rules. We introduce CDR-Agent, a novel LLM-based system designed to enhance ED decision-making by autonomously identifying and applying the most appropriate CDRs based on unstructured clinical notes. To validate CDR-Agent, we curated two novel ED datasets: synthetic and CDR-Bench, although CDR-Agent is applicable to non ED clinics. CDR-Agent achieves a 56.3\\% (synthetic) and 8.7\\% (CDR-Bench) accuracy gain relative to the standalone LLM baseline in CDR selection. Moreover, CDR-Agent significantly reduces computational overhead. Using these datasets, we demonstrated that CDR-Agent not only selects relevant CDRs efficiently, but makes cautious yet effective imaging decisions by minimizing unnecessary interventions while successfully identifying most positively diagnosed cases, outperforming traditional LLM prompting approaches.

{"title":"Exploring Scaling Laws for EHR Foundation Models","abstract":"The emergence of scaling laws has profoundly shaped the development of large language models (LLMs), enabling predictable performance gains through systematic increases in model size, dataset volume, and compute. Yet, these principles remain largely unexplored in the context of electronic health records (EHRs) -- a rich, sequential, and globally abundant data source that differs structurally from natural language. In this work, we present the first empirical investigation of scaling laws for EHR foundation models. By training transformer architectures on patient timeline data from the MIMIC-IV database across varying model sizes and compute budgets, we identify consistent scaling patterns, including parabolic IsoFLOPs curves and power-law relationships between compute, model parameters, data size, and clinical utility. These findings demonstrate that EHR models exhibit scaling behavior analogous to LLMs, offering predictive insights into resource-efficient training strategies. Our results lay the groundwork for developing powerful EHR foundation models capable of transforming clinical prediction tasks and advancing personalized healthcare."}
{"title":"ER-REASON: A Benchmark Dataset for LLM-Based Clinical Reasoning in the Emergency Room","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively evaluated on medical question answering tasks based on licensing exams. However, real-world evaluations often depend on costly human annotators, and existing benchmarks tend to focus on isolated tasks that rarely capture the clinical reasoning or full workflow underlying medical decisions. In this paper, we introduce ER-Reason, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based clinical reasoning and decision-making in the emergency room (ER)--a high-stakes setting where clinicians make rapid, consequential decisions across diverse patient presentations and medical specialties under time pressure. ER-Reason includes data from 3,984 patients, encompassing 25,174 de-identified longitudinal clinical notes spanning discharge summaries, progress notes, history and physical exams, consults, echocardiography reports, imaging notes, and ER provider documentation. The benchmark includes evaluation tasks that span key stages of the ER workflow: triage intake, initial assessment, treatment selection, disposition planning, and final diagnosis--each structured to reflect core clinical reasoning processes such as differential diagnosis via rule-out reasoning. We also collected 72 full physician-authored rationales explaining reasoning processes that mimic the teaching process used in residency training, and are typically absent from ER documentation. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on ER-Reason reveal a gap between LLM-generated and clinician-authored clinical reasoning for ER decisions, highlighting the need for future research to bridge this divide."}
{"title":"Reinforcement Learning for Out-of-Distribution Reasoning in LLMs: An Empirical Study on Diagnosis-Related Group Coding","abstract":"Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes are essential for hospital reimbursement and operations but require labor-intensive assignment. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data. We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks."}
{"title":"Query, Don't Train: Privacy-Preserving Tabular Prediction from EHR Data via SQL Queries","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) contain richly structured, longitudinal data essential for predictive modeling, yet stringent privacy regulations (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR) often restrict access to individual-level records. We introduce \\textbf{Query, Don't Train} (QDT): a \\textbf{structured-data foundation-model interface} enabling \\textbf{tabular inference} via LLM-generated SQL over EHRs. Instead of training on or accessing individual-level examples, QDT uses a large language model (LLM) as a schema-aware query planner to generate privacy-compliant SQL queries from a natural language task description and a test-time input. The model then extracts summary-level population statistics through these SQL queries, and the LLM performs chain-of-thought reasoning over the results to make predictions. This inference-time-only approach enables prediction without supervised model training, ensures interpretability through symbolic, auditable queries, naturally handles missing features without imputation or preprocessing, and effectively manages high-dimensional numerical data to enhance analytical capabilities. We validate QDT on the task of 30-day hospital readmission prediction for Type 2 diabetes patients using a MIMIC-style EHR cohort, achieving F1 = 0.70, which outperforms TabPFN (F1 = 0.68). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of LLM-driven, privacy-preserving structured prediction using only schema metadata and aggregate statistics -- offering a scalable, interpretable, and regulation-compliant alternative to conventional foundation-model pipelines."}
{"title":"multivariateGPT: a decoder-only transformer for multivariate categorical and numeric data","abstract":"Real-world processes often generate data that are a mix of categorical and numeric values that are recorded at irregular and informative intervals. Discrete token-based approaches are limited in numeric representation capacity while methods like neural ordinary differential equations are not well suited for categorical data or informative sampling and require augmentation to handle certain classes of trajectories. Here, we present multivariateGPT, a single architecture for modeling sequences of mixed categorical (including tokenized text) and numeric data. This is accomplished with an autoregressive sequence decomposition, embedding scheme, and loss function that extend the next token prediction task to likelihood estimation of the joint distribution of next token class and value. We demonstrate how this approach can efficiently learn to generalize patterns in simple physical systems and model complex time series including electrocardiograms and multivariate electronic health record data. This work extends the utility of transformer based models to additional classes of data."}
{"title":"Semi-supervised Clustering Through Representation Learning of Large-scale EHR Data","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHR) offer rich real-world data for personalized medicine, providing insights into disease progression, treatment responses, and patient outcomes. However, their sparsity, heterogeneity, and high dimensionality make them difficult to model, while the lack of standardized ground truth further complicates predictive modeling. To address these challenges, we propose SCORE, a semi-supervised representation learning framework that captures multi-domain disease profiles through patient embeddings. SCORE employs a Poisson-Adapted Latent factor Mixture (PALM) Model with pre-trained code embeddings to characterize codified features and extract meaningful patient phenotypes and embeddings. To handle the computational challenges of large-scale data, it introduces a hybrid Expectation-Maximization (EM) and Gaussian Variational Approximation (GVA) algorithm, leveraging limited labeled data to refine estimates on a vast pool of unlabeled samples. We theoretically establish the convergence of this hybrid approach, quantify GVA errors, and derive SCORE's error rate under diverging embedding dimensions. Our analysis shows that incorporating unlabeled data enhances accuracy and reduces sensitivity to label scarcity. Extensive simulations confirm SCORE's superior finite-sample performance over existing methods. Finally, we apply SCORE to predict disability status for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) using partially labeled EHR data, demonstrating that it produces more informative and predictive patient embeddings for multiple MS-related conditions compared to existing approaches."}
{"title":"MedHELM: Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Models for Medical Tasks","abstract":"While large language models (LLMs) achieve near-perfect scores on medical licensing exams, these evaluations inadequately reflect the complexity and diversity of real-world clinical practice. We introduce MedHELM, an extensible evaluation framework for assessing LLM performance for medical tasks with three key contributions. First, a clinician-validated taxonomy spanning 5 categories, 22 subcategories, and 121 tasks developed with 29 clinicians. Second, a comprehensive benchmark suite comprising 35 benchmarks (17 existing, 18 newly formulated) providing complete coverage of all categories and subcategories in the taxonomy. Third, a systematic comparison of LLMs with improved evaluation methods (using an LLM-jury) and a cost-performance analysis. Evaluation of 9 frontier LLMs, using the 35 benchmarks, revealed significant performance variation. Advanced reasoning models (DeepSeek R1: 66% win-rate; o3-mini: 64% win-rate) demonstrated superior performance, though Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved comparable results at 40% lower estimated computational cost. On a normalized accuracy scale (0-1), most models performed strongly in Clinical Note Generation (0.73-0.85) and Patient Communication & Education (0.78-0.83), moderately in Medical Research Assistance (0.65-0.75), and generally lower in Clinical Decision Support (0.56-0.72) and Administration & Workflow (0.53-0.63). Our LLM-jury evaluation method achieved good agreement with clinician ratings (ICC = 0.47), surpassing both average clinician-clinician agreement (ICC = 0.43) and automated baselines including ROUGE-L (0.36) and BERTScore-F1 (0.44). Claude 3.5 Sonnet achieved comparable performance to top models at lower estimated cost. These findings highlight the importance of real-world, task-specific evaluation for medical use of LLMs and provides an open source framework to enable this."}
{"title":"Ontology- and LLM-based Data Harmonization for Federated Learning in Healthcare","abstract":"The rise of electronic health records (EHRs) has unlocked new opportunities for medical research, but privacy regulations and data heterogeneity remain key barriers to large-scale machine learning. Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative modeling without sharing raw data, yet faces challenges in harmonizing diverse clinical datasets. This paper presents a two-step data alignment strategy integrating ontologies and large language models (LLMs) to support secure, privacy-preserving FL in healthcare, demonstrating its effectiveness in a real-world project involving semantic mapping of EHR data."}
{"title":"medDreamer: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Latent Imagination on Complex EHRs for Clinical Decision Support","abstract":"Timely and personalized treatment decisions are essential across a wide range of healthcare settings where patient responses can vary significantly and evolve over time. Clinical data used to support these treatment decisions are often irregularly sampled, where missing data frequencies may implicitly convey information about the patient's condition. Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) based clinical decision support systems often ignore the missing patterns and distort them with coarse discretization and simple imputation. They are also predominantly model-free and largely depend on retrospective data, which could lead to insufficient exploration and bias by historical behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose medDreamer, a novel model-based reinforcement learning framework for personalized treatment recommendation. medDreamer contains a world model with an Adaptive Feature Integration module that simulates latent patient states from irregular data and a two-phase policy trained on a hybrid of real and imagined trajectories. This enables learning optimal policies that go beyond the sub-optimality of historical clinical decisions, while remaining close to real clinical data. We evaluate medDreamer on both sepsis and mechanical ventilation treatment tasks using two large-scale Electronic Health Records (EHRs) datasets. Comprehensive evaluations show that medDreamer significantly outperforms model-free and model-based baselines in both clinical outcomes and off-policy metrics."}
{"title":"CardioCoT: Hierarchical Reasoning for Multimodal Survival Analysis","abstract":"Accurate prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events recurrence risk in acute myocardial infarction patients based on postoperative cardiac MRI and associated clinical notes is crucial for precision treatment and personalized intervention. Existing methods primarily focus on risk stratification capability while overlooking the need for intermediate robust reasoning and model interpretability in clinical practice. Moreover, end-to-end risk prediction using LLM\/VLM faces significant challenges due to data limitations and modeling complexity. To bridge this gap, we propose CardioCoT, a novel two-stage hierarchical reasoning-enhanced survival analysis framework designed to enhance both model interpretability and predictive performance. In the first stage, we employ an evidence-augmented self-refinement mechanism to guide LLM\/VLMs in generating robust hierarchical reasoning trajectories based on associated radiological findings. In the second stage, we integrate the reasoning trajectories with imaging data for risk model training and prediction. CardioCoT demonstrates superior performance in MACE recurrence risk prediction while providing interpretable reasoning processes, offering valuable insights for clinical decision-making."}
{"title":"Toward Human Centered Interactive Clinical Question Answering System","abstract":"Unstructured clinical notes contain essential patient information but are challenging for physicians to search and interpret efficiently. Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in question answering (QA), most existing systems lack transparency, usability, and alignment with clinical workflows. This work introduces an interactive QA system that enables physicians to query clinical notes via text or voice and receive extractive answers highlighted directly in the note for traceability.\n  The system was built using OpenAI models with zero-shot prompting and evaluated across multiple metrics, including exact string match, word overlap, SentenceTransformer similarity, and BERTScore. Results show that while exact match scores ranged from 47 to 62 percent, semantic similarity scores exceeded 87 percent, indicating strong contextual alignment even when wording varied.\n  To assess usability, the system was also evaluated using simulated clinical personas. Seven diverse physician and nurse personas interacted with the system across scenario-based tasks and provided structured feedback. The evaluations highlighted strengths in intuitive design and answer accessibility, alongside opportunities for enhancing explanation clarity."}
{"title":"RedactOR: An LLM-Powered Framework for Automatic Clinical Data De-Identification","abstract":"Ensuring clinical data privacy while preserving utility is critical for AI-driven healthcare and data analytics. Existing de-identification (De-ID) methods, including rule-based techniques, deep learning models, and large language models (LLMs), often suffer from recall errors, limited generalization, and inefficiencies, limiting their real-world applicability. We propose a fully automated, multi-modal framework, RedactOR for de-identifying structured and unstructured electronic health records, including clinical audio records. Our framework employs cost-efficient De-ID strategies, including intelligent routing, hybrid rule and LLM based approaches, and a two-step audio redaction approach. We present a retrieval-based entity relexicalization approach to ensure consistent substitutions of protected entities, thereby enhancing data coherence for downstream applications. We discuss key design desiderata, de-identification and relexicalization methodology, and modular architecture of RedactOR and its integration with the Oracle Health Clinical AI system. Evaluated on the i2b2 2014 De-ID dataset using standard metrics with strict recall, our approach achieves competitive performance while optimizing token usage to reduce LLM costs. Finally, we discuss key lessons and insights from deployment in real-world AI- driven healthcare data pipelines."}
{"title":"Will Large Language Models Transform Clinical Prediction?","abstract":"Objective: Large language models (LLMs) are attracting increasing interest in healthcare. This commentary evaluates the potential of LLMs to improve clinical prediction models (CPMs) for diagnostic and prognostic tasks, with a focus on their ability to process longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) data.\n  Findings: LLMs show promise in handling multimodal and longitudinal EHR data and can support multi-outcome predictions for diverse health conditions. However, methodological, validation, infrastructural, and regulatory chal- lenges remain. These include inadequate methods for time-to-event modelling, poor calibration of predictions, limited external validation, and bias affecting underrepresented groups. High infrastructure costs and the absence of clear regulatory frameworks further prevent adoption.\n  Implications: Further work and interdisciplinary collaboration are needed to support equitable and effective integra- tion into the clinical prediction. Developing temporally aware, fair, and explainable models should be a priority focus for transforming clinical prediction workflow."}
{"title":"Less Context, Same Performance: A RAG Framework for Resource-Efficient LLM-Based Clinical NLP","abstract":"Long text classification is challenging for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to token limits and high computational costs. This study explores whether a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach using only the most relevant text segments can match the performance of processing entire clinical notes with large context LLMs. We begin by splitting clinical documents into smaller chunks, converting them into vector embeddings, and storing these in a FAISS index. We then retrieve the top 4,000 words most pertinent to the classification query and feed these consolidated segments into an LLM. We evaluated three LLMs (GPT4o, LLaMA, and Mistral) on a surgical complication identification task. Metrics such as AUC ROC, precision, recall, and F1 showed no statistically significant differences between the RAG based approach and whole-text processing (p > 0.05p > 0.05). These findings indicate that RAG can significantly reduce token usage without sacrificing classification accuracy, providing a scalable and cost effective solution for analyzing lengthy clinical documents."}
{"title":"Bridging Electronic Health Records and Clinical Texts: Contrastive Learning for Enhanced Clinical Tasks","abstract":"Conventional machine learning models, particularly tree-based approaches, have demonstrated promising performance across various clinical prediction tasks using electronic health record (EHR) data. Despite their strengths, these models struggle with tasks that require deeper contextual understanding, such as predicting 30-day hospital readmission. This can be primarily due to the limited semantic information available in structured EHR data. To address this limitation, we propose a deep multimodal contrastive learning (CL) framework that aligns the latent representations of structured EHR data with unstructured discharge summary notes. It works by pulling together paired EHR and text embeddings while pushing apart unpaired ones. Fine-tuning the pretrained EHR encoder extracted from this framework significantly boosts downstream task performance, e.g., a 4.1% AUROC enhancement over XGBoost for 30-day readmission prediction. Such results demonstrate the effect of integrating domain knowledge from clinical notes into EHR-based pipelines, enabling more accurate and context-aware clinical decision support systems."}
{"title":"Harnessing EHRs for Diffusion-based Anomaly Detection on Chest X-rays","abstract":"Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) in medical imaging is crucial for identifying pathological abnormalities without requiring extensive labeled data. However, existing diffusion-based UAD models rely solely on imaging features, limiting their ability to distinguish between normal anatomical variations and pathological anomalies. To address this, we propose Diff3M, a multi-modal diffusion-based framework that integrates chest X-rays and structured Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for enhanced anomaly detection. Specifically, we introduce a novel image-EHR cross-attention module to incorporate structured clinical context into the image generation process, improving the model's ability to differentiate normal from abnormal features. Additionally, we develop a static masking strategy to enhance the reconstruction of normal-like images from anomalies. Extensive evaluations on CheXpert and MIMIC-CXR\/IV demonstrate that Diff3M achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing UAD methods in medical imaging.

{"title":"On Fisher Consistency of Surrogate Losses for Optimal Dynamic Treatment Regimes with Multiple Categorical Treatments per Stage","abstract":"Patients with chronic diseases often receive treatments at multiple time points, or stages. Our goal is to learn the optimal dynamic treatment regime (DTR) from longitudinal patient data. When both the number of stages and the number of treatment levels per stage are arbitrary, estimating the optimal DTR reduces to a sequential, weighted, multiclass classification problem (Kosorok and Laber, 2019). In this paper, we aim to solve this classification problem simultaneously across all stages using Fisher consistent surrogate losses. Although computationally feasible Fisher consistent surrogates exist in special cases, e.g., the binary treatment setting, a unified theory of Fisher consistency remains largely unexplored. We establish necessary and sufficient conditions for DTR Fisher consistency within the class of non-negative, stagewise separable surrogate losses. To our knowledge, this is the first result in the DTR literature to provide necessary conditions for Fisher consistency within a non-trivial surrogate class. Furthermore, we show that many convex surrogate losses fail to be Fisher consistent for the DTR classification problem, and we formally establish this inconsistency for smooth, permutation equivariant, and relative-margin-based convex losses. Building on this, we propose SDSS (Simultaneous Direct Search with Surrogates), which uses smooth, non-concave surrogate losses to learn the optimal DTR. We develop a computationally efficient, gradient-based algorithm for SDSS. When the optimization error is small, we establish a sharp upper bound on SDSS's regret decay rate. We evaluate the numerical performance of SDSS through simulations and demonstrate its real-world applicability by estimating optimal fluid resuscitation strategies for severe septic patients using electronic health record data."}
{"title":"FoMoH: A clinically meaningful foundation model evaluation for structured electronic health records","abstract":"Foundation models hold significant promise in healthcare, given their capacity to extract meaningful representations independent of downstream tasks. This property has enabled state-of-the-art performance across several clinical applications trained on structured electronic health record (EHR) data, even in settings with limited labeled data, a prevalent challenge in healthcare. However, there is little consensus on these models' potential for clinical utility due to the lack of desiderata of comprehensive and meaningful tasks and sufficiently diverse evaluations to characterize the benefit over conventional supervised learning. To address this gap, we propose a suite of clinically meaningful tasks spanning patient outcomes, early prediction of acute and chronic conditions, including desiderata for robust evaluations. We evaluate state-of-the-art foundation models on EHR data consisting of 5 million patients from Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUMC), a large urban academic medical center in New York City, across 14 clinically relevant tasks. We measure overall accuracy, calibration, and subpopulation performance to surface tradeoffs based on the choice of pre-training, tokenization, and data representation strategies. Our study aims to advance the empirical evaluation of structured EHR foundation models and guide the development of future healthcare foundation models."}
{"title":"No Black Boxes: Interpretable and Interactable Predictive Healthcare with Knowledge-Enhanced Agentic Causal Discovery","abstract":"Deep learning models trained on extensive Electronic Health Records (EHR) data have achieved high accuracy in diagnosis prediction, offering the potential to assist clinicians in decision-making and treatment planning. However, these models lack two crucial features that clinicians highly value: interpretability and interactivity. The ``black-box'' nature of these models makes it difficult for clinicians to understand the reasoning behind predictions, limiting their ability to make informed decisions. Additionally, the absence of interactive mechanisms prevents clinicians from incorporating their own knowledge and experience into the decision-making process. To address these limitations, we propose II-KEA, a knowledge-enhanced agent-driven causal discovery framework that integrates personalized knowledge databases and agentic LLMs. II-KEA enhances interpretability through explicit reasoning and causal analysis, while also improving interactivity by allowing clinicians to inject their knowledge and experience through customized knowledge bases and prompts. II-KEA is evaluated on both MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, demonstrating superior performance along with enhanced interpretability and interactivity, as evidenced by its strong results from extensive case studies."}
{"title":"Developing clinical informatics to support direct care and population health management: the VIEWER story","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) provide comprehensive patient data which could be better used to enhance informed decision-making, resource allocation, and coordinated care, thereby optimising healthcare delivery. However, in mental healthcare, critical information, such as on risk factors, precipitants, and treatment responses, is often embedded in unstructured text, limiting the ability to automate at scale measures to identify and prioritise local populations and patients, which potentially hinders timely prevention and intervention. We describe the development and proof-of-concept implementation of VIEWER, a clinical informatics platform designed to enhance direct patient care and population health management by improving the accessibility and usability of EHR data. We further outline strategies that were employed in this work to foster informatics innovation through interdisciplinary and cross-organisational collaboration to support integrated, personalised care, and detail how these advancements were piloted and implemented within a large UK mental health National Health Service Foundation Trust to improve patient outcomes at an individual patient, clinician, clinical team, and organisational level."}
{"title":"Are LLMs reliable? An exploration of the reliability of large language models in clinical note generation","abstract":"Due to the legal and ethical responsibilities of healthcare providers (HCPs) for accurate documentation and protection of patient data privacy, the natural variability in the responses of large language models (LLMs) presents challenges for incorporating clinical note generation (CNG) systems, driven by LLMs, into real-world clinical processes. The complexity is further amplified by the detailed nature of texts in CNG. To enhance the confidence of HCPs in tools powered by LLMs, this study evaluates the reliability of 12 open-weight and proprietary LLMs from Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, and OpenAI in CNG in terms of their ability to generate notes that are string equivalent (consistency rate), have the same meaning (semantic consistency) and are correct (semantic similarity), across several iterations using the same prompt. The results show that (1) LLMs from all model families are stable, such that their responses are semantically consistent despite being written in various ways, and (2) most of the LLMs generated notes close to the corresponding notes made by experts. Overall, Meta's Llama 70B was the most reliable, followed by Mistral's Small model. With these findings, we recommend the local deployment of these relatively smaller open-weight models for CNG to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations, as well as to improve the efficiency of HCPs in clinical documentation."}
{"title":"Diagnosing our datasets: How does my language model learn clinical information?","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have performed well across various clinical natural language processing tasks, despite not being directly trained on electronic health record (EHR) data. In this work, we examine how popular open-source LLMs learn clinical information from large mined corpora through two crucial but understudied lenses: (1) their interpretation of clinical jargon, a foundational ability for understanding real-world clinical notes, and (2) their responses to unsupported medical claims. For both use cases, we investigate the frequency of relevant clinical information in their corresponding pretraining corpora, the relationship between pretraining data composition and model outputs, and the sources underlying this data. To isolate clinical jargon understanding, we evaluate LLMs on a new dataset MedLingo. Unsurprisingly, we find that the frequency of clinical jargon mentions across major pretraining corpora correlates with model performance. However, jargon frequently appearing in clinical notes often rarely appears in pretraining corpora, revealing a mismatch between available data and real-world usage. Similarly, we find that a non-negligible portion of documents support disputed claims that can then be parroted by models. Finally, we classified and analyzed the types of online sources in which clinical jargon and unsupported medical claims appear, with implications for future dataset composition."}
{"title":"Early Diagnosis of Atrial Fibrillation Recurrence: A Large Tabular Model Approach with Structured and Unstructured Clinical Data","abstract":"BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common arrhythmia, is linked to high morbidity and mortality. In a fast-evolving AF rhythm control treatment era, predicting AF recurrence after its onset may be crucial to achieve the optimal therapeutic approach, yet traditional scores like CHADS2-VASc, HATCH, and APPLE show limited predictive accuracy. Moreover, early diagnosis studies often rely on codified electronic health record (EHR) data, which may contain errors and missing information.\n  OBJECTIVE: This study aims to predict AF recurrence between one month and two years after onset by evaluating traditional clinical scores, ML models, and our LTM approach. Moreover, another objective is to develop a methodology for integrating structured and unstructured data to enhance tabular dataset quality.\n  METHODS: A tabular dataset was generated by combining structured clinical data with free-text discharge reports processed through natural language processing techniques, reducing errors and annotation effort. A total of 1,508 patients with documented AF onset were identified, and models were evaluated on a manually annotated test set. The proposed approach includes a LTM compared against traditional clinical scores and ML models.\n  RESULTS: The proposed LTM approach achieved the highest predictive performance, surpassing both traditional clinical scores and ML models. Additionally, the gender and age bias analyses revealed demographic disparities.\n  CONCLUSION: The integration of structured data and free-text sources resulted in a high-quality dataset. The findings emphasize the limitations of traditional clinical scores in predicting AF recurrence and highlight the potential of ML-based approaches, particularly our LTM model."}
{"title":"hChain 4.0: A Secure and Scalable Permissioned Blockchain for EHR Management in Smart Healthcare","abstract":"The growing utilization of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices, including smartwatches and wearable medical devices, has facilitated real-time health monitoring and data analysis to enhance healthcare outcomes. These gadgets necessitate improved security measures to safeguard sensitive health data while tackling scalability issues in real-time settings. The proposed system, hChain 4.0, employs a permissioned blockchain to provide a secure and scalable data infrastructure designed to fulfill these needs. This stands in contrast to conventional systems, which are vulnerable to security flaws or rely on public blockchains, constrained by scalability and expense. The proposed approach introduces a high-privacy method in which health data are encrypted using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for time-efficient encryption, combined with Partial Homomorphic Encryption (PHE) to enable secure computations on encrypted data, thereby enhancing privacy. Moreover, it utilizes private channels that enable isolated communication and ledger between stakeholders, ensuring robust privacy while supporting collaborative operations. The proposed framework enables anonymized health data sharing for medical research by pseudonymizing patient identity. Additionally, hChain 4.0 incorporates Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) to provide secure electronic health record (EHR) sharing among authorized parties, where ABAC ensures fine-grained permission management vital for multi-organizational healthcare settings. Experimental assessments indicate that the proposed approach achieves higher scalability, cost-effectiveness, and validated security."}
{"title":"GAP: Graph-Assisted Prompts for Dialogue-based Medication Recommendation","abstract":"Medication recommendations have become an important task in the healthcare domain, especially in measuring the accuracy and safety of medical dialogue systems (MDS). Different from the recommendation task based on electronic health records (EHRs), dialogue-based medication recommendations require research on the interaction details between patients and doctors, which is crucial but may not exist in EHRs. Recent advancements in large language models (LLM) have extended the medical dialogue domain. These LLMs can interpret patients' intent and provide medical suggestions including medication recommendations, but some challenges are still worth attention. During a multi-turn dialogue, LLMs may ignore the fine-grained medical information or connections across the dialogue turns, which is vital for providing accurate suggestions. Besides, LLMs may generate non-factual responses when there is a lack of domain-specific knowledge, which is more risky in the medical domain. To address these challenges, we propose a \\textbf{G}raph-\\textbf{A}ssisted \\textbf{P}rompts (\\textbf{GAP}) framework for dialogue-based medication recommendation. It extracts medical concepts and corresponding states from dialogue to construct an explicitly patient-centric graph, which can describe the neglected but important information. Further, combined with external medical knowledge graphs, GAP can generate abundant queries and prompts, thus retrieving information from multiple sources to reduce the non-factual responses. We evaluate GAP on a dialogue-based medication recommendation dataset and further explore its potential in a more difficult scenario, dynamically diagnostic interviewing. Extensive experiments demonstrate its competitive performance when compared with strong baselines."}
{"title":"Re-identification of De-identified Documents with Autoregressive Infilling","abstract":"Documents revealing sensitive information about individuals must typically be de-identified. This de-identification is often done by masking all mentions of personally identifiable information (PII), thereby making it more difficult to uncover the identity of the person(s) in question. To investigate the robustness of de-identification methods, we present a novel, RAG-inspired approach that attempts the reverse process of re-identification based on a database of documents representing background knowledge. Given a text in which personal identifiers have been masked, the re-identification proceeds in two steps. A retriever first selects from the background knowledge passages deemed relevant for the re-identification. Those passages are then provided to an infilling model which seeks to infer the original content of each text span. This process is repeated until all masked spans are replaced. We evaluate the re-identification on three datasets (Wikipedia biographies, court rulings and clinical notes). Results show that (1) as many as 80% of de-identified text spans can be successfully recovered and (2) the re-identification accuracy increases along with the level of background knowledge."}
{"title":"Decoding Rarity: Large Language Models in the Diagnosis of Rare Diseases","abstract":"Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models LLMs, have shown promising capabilities in transforming rare disease research. This survey paper explores the integration of LLMs in the analysis of rare diseases, highlighting significant strides and pivotal studies that leverage textual data to uncover insights and patterns critical for diagnosis, treatment, and patient care. While current research predominantly employs textual data, the potential for multimodal data integration combining genetic, imaging, and electronic health records stands as a promising frontier. We review foundational papers that demonstrate the application of LLMs in identifying and extracting relevant medical information, simulating intelligent conversational agents for patient interaction, and enabling the formulation of accurate and timely diagnoses. Furthermore, this paper discusses the challenges and ethical considerations inherent in deploying LLMs, including data privacy, model transparency, and the need for robust, inclusive data sets. As part of this exploration, we present a section on experimentation that utilizes multiple LLMs alongside structured questionnaires, specifically designed for diagnostic purposes in the context of different diseases. We conclude with future perspectives on the evolution of LLMs towards truly multimodal platforms, which would integrate diverse data types to provide a more comprehensive understanding of rare diseases, ultimately fostering better outcomes in clinical settings."}
{"title":"MedAgentBoard: Benchmarking Multi-Agent Collaboration with Conventional Methods for Diverse Medical Tasks","abstract":"The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has stimulated interest in multi-agent collaboration for addressing complex medical tasks. However, the practical advantages of multi-agent collaboration approaches remain insufficiently understood. Existing evaluations often lack generalizability, failing to cover diverse tasks reflective of real-world clinical practice, and frequently omit rigorous comparisons against both single-LLM-based and established conventional methods. To address this critical gap, we introduce MedAgentBoard, a comprehensive benchmark for the systematic evaluation of multi-agent collaboration, single-LLM, and conventional approaches. MedAgentBoard encompasses four diverse medical task categories: (1) medical (visual) question answering, (2) lay summary generation, (3) structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) predictive modeling, and (4) clinical workflow automation, across text, medical images, and structured EHR data. Our extensive experiments reveal a nuanced landscape: while multi-agent collaboration demonstrates benefits in specific scenarios, such as enhancing task completeness in clinical workflow automation, it does not consistently outperform advanced single LLMs (e.g., in textual medical QA) or, critically, specialized conventional methods that generally maintain better performance in tasks like medical VQA and EHR-based prediction. MedAgentBoard offers a vital resource and actionable insights, emphasizing the necessity of a task-specific, evidence-based approach to selecting and developing AI solutions in medicine. It underscores that the inherent complexity and overhead of multi-agent collaboration must be carefully weighed against tangible performance gains. All code, datasets, detailed prompts, and experimental results are open-sourced at https:\/\/medagentboard.netlify.app\/."}
{"title":"Reliable fairness auditing with semi-supervised inference","abstract":"Machine learning (ML) models often exhibit bias that can exacerbate inequities in biomedical applications. Fairness auditing, the process of evaluating a model's performance across subpopulations, is critical for identifying and mitigating these biases. However, such audits typically rely on large volumes of labeled data, which are costly and labor-intensive to obtain. To address this challenge, we introduce $\\textit{Infairness}$, a unified framework for auditing a wide range of fairness criteria using semi-supervised inference. Our approach combines a small labeled dataset with a large unlabeled dataset by imputing missing outcomes via regression with carefully selected nonlinear basis functions. We show that our proposed estimator is (i) consistent regardless of whether the ML or imputation models are correctly specified and (ii) more efficient than standard supervised estimation with the labeled data when the imputation model is correctly specified. Through extensive simulations, we also demonstrate that Infairness consistently achieves higher precision than supervised estimation. In a real-world application of phenotyping depression from electronic health records data, Infairness reduces variance by up to 64% compared to supervised estimation, underscoring its value for reliable fairness auditing with limited labeled data."}
{"title":"Diffmv: A Unified Diffusion Framework for Healthcare Predictions with Random Missing Views and View Laziness","abstract":"Advanced healthcare predictions offer significant improvements in patient outcomes by leveraging predictive analytics. Existing works primarily utilize various views of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, such as diagnoses, lab tests, or clinical notes, for model training. These methods typically assume the availability of complete EHR views and that the designed model could fully leverage the potential of each view. However, in practice, random missing views and view laziness present two significant challenges that hinder further improvements in multi-view utilization. To address these challenges, we introduce Diffmv, an innovative diffusion-based generative framework designed to advance the exploitation of multiple views of EHR data. Specifically, to address random missing views, we integrate various views of EHR data into a unified diffusion-denoising framework, enriched with diverse contextual conditions to facilitate progressive alignment and view transformation. To mitigate view laziness, we propose a novel reweighting strategy that assesses the relative advantages of each view, promoting a balanced utilization of various data views within the model. Our proposed strategy achieves superior performance across multiple health prediction tasks derived from three popular datasets, including multi-view and multi-modality scenarios."}
{"title":"METHOD: Modular Efficient Transformer for Health Outcome Discovery","abstract":"Recent advances in transformer architectures have revolutionised natural language processing, but their application to healthcare domains presents unique challenges. Patient timelines are characterised by irregular sampling, variable temporal dependencies, and complex contextual relationships that differ substantially from traditional language tasks. This paper introduces \\METHOD~(Modular Efficient Transformer for Health Outcome Discovery), a novel transformer architecture specifically designed to address the challenges of clinical sequence modelling in electronic health records. \\METHOD~integrates three key innovations: (1) a patient-aware attention mechanism that prevents information leakage whilst enabling efficient batch processing; (2) an adaptive sliding window attention scheme that captures multi-scale temporal dependencies; and (3) a U-Net inspired architecture with dynamic skip connections for effective long sequence processing. Evaluations on the MIMIC-IV database demonstrate that \\METHOD~consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art \\ETHOS~model, particularly in predicting high-severity cases that require urgent clinical intervention. \\METHOD~exhibits stable performance across varying inference lengths, a crucial feature for clinical deployment where patient histories vary significantly in length. Analysis of learned embeddings reveals that \\METHOD~better preserves clinical hierarchies and relationships between medical concepts. These results suggest that \\METHOD~represents a significant advancement in transformer architectures optimised for healthcare applications, providing more accurate and clinically relevant predictions whilst maintaining computational efficiency."}
{"title":"Age-stratified clustering of multiple long-term conditions","abstract":"Background: Most people with any long-term condition have multiple long-term conditions, but our understanding of how conditions cluster is limited. Many clustering studies identify clusters in the whole population, but the clusters that occur in people of different ages may be distinct. The aim of this paper was to explore similarities and differences in clusters found in different age-groups.\n  Method: We present a method for finding similar clusters in multiple age-groups, referred to as cluster sets, using Latent Class Analysis (LCA) and Chebyshev distance metric. We analyse a primary care electronic health record (EHR) dataset recording the presence of 40 long-term conditions (LTCs) in 570,355 people aged 40-99 years with at least one of these conditions, analysing in five-year age-groups.\n  Findings: We find that the 600 clusters found separately in 12 age-strata can be summarised by 342 cluster sets with 263 cluster sets only being found in a single age-group (singleton cluster sets), and 79 cluster sets being present in multiple age-groups. We observe that 31 conditions of the 40 conditions studied appear in cluster sets with the respective condition being the only condition present with a very high prevalence of more than 0.9 whereas the remaining cluster sets typically contain two to four conditions present with a high prevalence of more than 0.7.\n  Interpretation: Multimorbidity profiles in different age-groups are often distinct (singleton cluster sets observed only in that age-group), but similar clusters with small variations in their composition are also found in multiple age-groups. This demonstrates the age dependency of MLTC clusters and presents a case for age-stratified clustering."}
{"title":"Assessing the Quality of AI-Generated Clinical Notes: A Validated Evaluation of a Large Language Model Scribe","abstract":"In medical practices across the United States, physicians have begun implementing generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools to perform the function of scribes in order to reduce the burden of documenting clinical encounters. Despite their widespread use, no established methods exist to gauge the quality of AI scribes. To address this gap, we developed a blinded study comparing the relative performance of large language model (LLM) generated clinical notes with those from field experts based on audio-recorded clinical encounters. Quantitative metrics from the Physician Documentation Quality Instrument (PDQI9) provided a framework to measure note quality, which we adapted to assess relative performance of AI generated notes. Clinical experts spanning 5 medical specialties used the PDQI9 tool to evaluate specialist-drafted Gold notes and LLM authored Ambient notes. Two evaluators from each specialty scored notes drafted from a total of 97 patient visits. We found uniformly high inter rater agreement (RWG greater than 0.7) between evaluators in general medicine, orthopedics, and obstetrics and gynecology, and moderate (RWG 0.5 to 0.7) to high inter rater agreement in pediatrics and cardiology. We found a modest yet significant difference in the overall note quality, wherein Gold notes achieved a score of 4.25 out of 5 and Ambient notes scored 4.20 out of 5 (p = 0.04). Our findings support the use of the PDQI9 instrument as a practical method to gauge the quality of LLM authored notes, as compared to human-authored notes."}
{"title":"Automated Detection of Clinical Entities in Lung and Breast Cancer Reports Using NLP Techniques","abstract":"Research projects, including those focused on cancer, rely on the manual extraction of information from clinical reports. This process is time-consuming and prone to errors, limiting the efficiency of data-driven approaches in healthcare. To address these challenges, Natural Language Processing (NLP) offers an alternative for automating the extraction of relevant data from electronic health records (EHRs). In this study, we focus on lung and breast cancer due to their high incidence and the significant impact they have on public health. Early detection and effective data management in both types of cancer are crucial for improving patient outcomes. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data extraction, we utilized GMV's NLP tool uQuery, which excels at identifying relevant entities in clinical texts and converting them into standardized formats such as SNOMED and OMOP. uQuery not only detects and classifies entities but also associates them with contextual information, including negated entities, temporal aspects, and patient-related details. In this work, we explore the use of NLP techniques, specifically Named Entity Recognition (NER), to automatically identify and extract key clinical information from EHRs related to these two cancers. A dataset from Health Research Institute Hospital La Fe (IIS La Fe), comprising 200 annotated breast cancer and 400 lung cancer reports, was used, with eight clinical entities manually labeled using the Doccano platform. To perform NER, we fine-tuned the bsc-bio-ehr-en3 model, a RoBERTa-based biomedical linguistic model pre-trained in Spanish. Fine-tuning was performed using the Transformers architecture, enabling accurate recognition of clinical entities in these cancer types. Our results demonstrate strong overall performance, particularly in identifying entities like MET and PAT, although challenges remain with less frequent entities like EVOL."}
{"title":"LLM-based Prompt Ensemble for Reliable Medical Entity Recognition from EHRs","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are digital records of patient information, often containing unstructured clinical text. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is essential in EHRs for extracting key medical entities like problems, tests, and treatments to support downstream clinical applications. This paper explores prompt-based medical entity recognition using large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o and DeepSeek-R1, guided by various prompt engineering techniques, including zero-shot, few-shot, and an ensemble approach. Among all strategies, GPT-4o with prompt ensemble achieved the highest classification performance with an F1-score of 0.95 and recall of 0.98, outperforming DeepSeek-R1 on the task. The ensemble method improved reliability by aggregating outputs through embedding-based similarity and majority voting."}
{"title":"Doubly Robust Fusion of Many Treatments for Policy Learning","abstract":"Individualized treatment rules\/recommendations (ITRs) aim to improve patient outcomes by tailoring treatments to the characteristics of each individual. However, when there are many treatment groups, existing methods face significant challenges due to data sparsity within treatment groups and highly unbalanced covariate distributions across groups. To address these challenges, we propose a novel calibration-weighted treatment fusion procedure that robustly balances covariates across treatment groups and fuses similar treatments using a penalized working model. The fusion procedure ensures the recovery of latent treatment group structures when either the calibration model or the outcome model is correctly specified. In the fused treatment space, practitioners can seamlessly apply state-of-the-art ITR learning methods with the flexibility to utilize a subset of covariates, thereby achieving robustness while addressing practical concerns such as fairness. We establish theoretical guarantees, including consistency, the oracle property of treatment fusion, and regret bounds when integrated with multi-armed ITR learning methods such as policy trees. Simulation studies show superior group recovery and policy value compared to existing approaches. We illustrate the practical utility of our method using a nationwide electronic health record-derived de-identified database containing data from patients with Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia and Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma."}
{"title":"\"I Apologize For Not Understanding Your Policy\": Exploring the Specification and Evaluation of User-Managed Access Control Policies by AI Virtual Assistants","abstract":"The rapid evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Virtual Assistants (VAs) e.g., Google Gemini, ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and High-Flyer Deepseek has turned them into convenient interfaces for managing emerging technologies such as Smart Homes, Smart Cars, Electronic Health Records, by means of explicit commands,e.g., prompts, which can be even launched via voice, thus providing a very convenient interface for end-users. However, the proper specification and evaluation of User-Managed Access Control Policies (U-MAPs), the rules issued and managed by end-users to govern access to sensitive data and device functionality - within these VAs presents significant challenges, since such a process is crucial for preventing security vulnerabilities and privacy leaks without impacting user experience. This study provides an initial exploratory investigation on whether current publicly-available VAs can manage U-MAPs effectively across differing scenarios. By conducting unstructured to structured tests, we evaluated the comprehension of such VAs, revealing a lack of understanding in varying U-MAP approaches. Our research not only identifies key limitations, but offers valuable insights into how VAs can be further improved to manage complex authorization rules and adapt to dynamic changes."}
{"title":"Dynamical Label Augmentation and Calibration for Noisy Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Medical research, particularly in predicting patient outcomes, heavily relies on medical time series data extracted from Electronic Health Records (EHR), which provide extensive information on patient histories. Despite rigorous examination, labeling errors are inevitable and can significantly impede accurate predictions of patient outcome. To address this challenge, we propose an \\textbf{A}ttention-based Learning Framework with Dynamic \\textbf{C}alibration and Augmentation for \\textbf{T}ime series Noisy \\textbf{L}abel \\textbf{L}earning (ACTLL). This framework leverages a two-component Beta mixture model to identify the certain and uncertain sets of instances based on the fitness distribution of each class, and it captures global temporal dynamics while dynamically calibrating labels from the uncertain set or augmenting confident instances from the certain set. Experimental results on large-scale EHR datasets eICU and MIMIC-IV-ED, and several benchmark datasets from the UCR and UEA repositories, demonstrate that our model ACTLL has achieved state-of-the-art performance, especially under high noise levels."}

Despite its potential to improve diagnostic accuracy and support personalized care, modeling such heterogeneous data presents significant technical challenges. This systematic review synthesizes findings from 69 studies to identify common obstacles, including missing modalities, limited sample sizes, dimensionality imbalance, interpretability issues, and finding the optimal fusion techniques.

{"title":"Multimodal Integrated Knowledge Transfer to Large Language Models through Preference Optimization with Biomedical Applications","abstract":"The scarcity of high-quality multimodal biomedical data limits the ability to effectively fine-tune pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for specialized biomedical tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce MINT (Multimodal Integrated kNowledge Transfer), a framework that aligns unimodal large decoder models with domain-specific decision patterns from multimodal biomedical data through preference optimization. While MINT supports different optimization techniques, we primarily implement it with the Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) framework as its backbone. This strategy enables the aligned LLMs to perform predictive tasks using text-only or image-only inputs while retaining knowledge learnt from multimodal data. MINT leverages an upstream multimodal machine learning (MML) model trained on high-quality multimodal data to transfer domain-specific insights to downstream text-only or image-only LLMs. We demonstrate its effectiveness through two key applications: (1) Rare genetic disease prediction from texts, where MINT uses a multimodal encoder model, trained on facial photos and clinical notes, to generate a preference dataset for aligning a lightweight Llama 3.2-3B-Instruct. Despite relying on text input only, the MINT-derived model outperforms models trained with SFT, RAG, or DPO, and even outperforms Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct. (2) Tissue type classification using cell nucleus images, where MINT uses a vision-language foundation model as the preference generator, containing knowledge learnt from both text and histopathological images to align downstream image-only models. The resulting MINT-derived model significantly improves the performance of Llama 3.2-Vision-11B-Instruct on tissue type classification. In summary, MINT provides an effective strategy to align unimodal LLMs with high-quality multimodal expertise through preference optimization."}
{"title":"Uncertainty-Aware Large Language Models for Explainable Disease Diagnosis","abstract":"Explainable disease diagnosis, which leverages patient information (e.g., signs and symptoms) and computational models to generate probable diagnoses and reasonings, offers clear clinical values. However, when clinical notes encompass insufficient evidence for a definite diagnosis, such as the absence of definitive symptoms, diagnostic uncertainty usually arises, increasing the risk of misdiagnosis and adverse outcomes. Although explicitly identifying and explaining diagnostic uncertainties is essential for trustworthy diagnostic systems, it remains under-explored. To fill this gap, we introduce ConfiDx, an uncertainty-aware large language model (LLM) created by fine-tuning open-source LLMs with diagnostic criteria. We formalized the task and assembled richly annotated datasets that capture varying degrees of diagnostic ambiguity. Evaluating ConfiDx on real-world datasets demonstrated that it excelled in identifying diagnostic uncertainties, achieving superior diagnostic performance, and generating trustworthy explanations for diagnoses and uncertainties. To our knowledge, this is the first study to jointly address diagnostic uncertainty recognition and explanation, substantially enhancing the reliability of automatic diagnostic systems."}
{"title":"Balancing Interpretability and Flexibility in Modeling Diagnostic Trajectories with an Embedded Neural Hawkes Process Model","abstract":"The Hawkes process (HP) is commonly used to model event sequences with self-reinforcing dynamics, including electronic health records (EHRs). Traditional HPs capture self-reinforcement via parametric impact functions that can be inspected to understand how each event modulates the intensity of others. Neural network-based HPs offer greater flexibility, resulting in improved fit and prediction performance, but at the cost of interpretability, which is often critical in healthcare. In this work, we aim to understand and improve upon this tradeoff. We propose a novel HP formulation in which impact functions are modeled by defining a flexible impact kernel, instantiated as a neural network, in event embedding space, which allows us to model large-scale event sequences with many event types. This approach is more flexible than traditional HPs yet more interpretable than other neural network approaches, and allows us to explicitly trade flexibility for interpretability by adding transformer encoder layers to further contextualize the event embeddings. Results show that our method accurately recovers impact functions in simulations, achieves competitive performance on MIMIC-IV procedure dataset, and gains clinically meaningful interpretation on Duke-EHR with children diagnosis dataset even without transformer layers. This suggests that our flexible impact kernel is often sufficient to capture self-reinforcing dynamics in EHRs and other data effectively, implying that interpretability can be maintained without loss of performance."}
{"title":"Leveraging Generative AI Through Prompt Engineering and Rigorous Validation to Create Comprehensive Synthetic Datasets for AI Training in Healthcare","abstract":"Access to high-quality medical data is often restricted due to privacy concerns, posing significant challenges for training artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms within Electronic Health Record (EHR) applications. In this study, prompt engineering with the GPT-4 API was employed to generate high-quality synthetic datasets aimed at overcoming this limitation. The generated data encompassed a comprehensive array of patient admission information, including healthcare provider details, hospital departments, wards, bed assignments, patient demographics, emergency contacts, vital signs, immunizations, allergies, medical histories, appointments, hospital visits, laboratory tests, diagnoses, treatment plans, medications, clinical notes, visit logs, discharge summaries, and referrals. To ensure data quality and integrity, advanced validation techniques were implemented utilizing models such as BERT's Next Sentence Prediction for sentence coherence, GPT-2 for overall plausibility, RoBERTa for logical consistency, autoencoders for anomaly detection, and conducted diversity analysis. Synthetic data that met all validation criteria were integrated into a comprehensive PostgreSQL database, serving as the data management system for the EHR application. This approach demonstrates that leveraging generative AI models with rigorous validation can effectively produce high-quality synthetic medical data, facilitating the training of AI algorithms while addressing privacy concerns associated with real patient data."}
{"title":"Revisiting the MIMIC-IV Benchmark: Experiments Using Language Models for Electronic Health Records","abstract":"The lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks in the medical domain for text inputs can be a barrier to widely adopting and leveraging the potential of natural language models for health-related downstream tasks. This paper revisited an openly available MIMIC-IV benchmark for electronic health records (EHRs) to address this issue. First, we integrate the MIMIC-IV data within the Hugging Face datasets library to allow an easy share and use of this collection. Second, we investigate the application of templates to convert EHR tabular data to text. Experiments using fine-tuned and zero-shot LLMs on the mortality of patients task show that fine-tuned text-based models are competitive against robust tabular classifiers. In contrast, zero-shot LLMs struggle to leverage EHR representations. This study underlines the potential of text-based approaches in the medical field and highlights areas for further improvement."}
{"title":"A Multimodal Pipeline for Clinical Data Extraction: Applying Vision-Language Models to Scans of Transfusion Reaction Reports","abstract":"Despite the growing adoption of electronic health records, many processes still rely on paper documents, reflecting the heterogeneous real-world conditions in which healthcare is delivered. The manual transcription process is time-consuming and prone to errors when transferring paper-based data to digital formats. To streamline this workflow, this study presents an open-source pipeline that extracts and categorizes checkbox data from scanned documents. Demonstrated on transfusion reaction reports, the design supports adaptation to other checkbox-rich document types. The proposed method integrates checkbox detection, multilingual optical character recognition (OCR) and multilingual vision-language models (VLMs). The pipeline achieves high precision and recall compared against annually compiled gold-standards from 2017 to 2024. The result is a reduction in administrative workload and accurate regulatory reporting. The open-source availability of this pipeline encourages self-hosted parsing of checkbox forms."}
{"title":"BRIDGE: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Understanding Real-world Clinical Practice Text","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for medical applications and are evolving rapidly, with new models being released at an accelerated pace. However, benchmarking on large-scale real-world data such as electronic health records (EHRs) is critical, as clinical decisions are directly informed by these sources, yet current evaluations remain limited. Most existing benchmarks rely on medical exam-style questions or PubMed-derived text, failing to capture the complexity of real-world clinical data. Others focus narrowly on specific application scenarios, limiting their generalizability across broader clinical use. To address this gap, we present BRIDGE, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 87 tasks sourced from real-world clinical data sources across nine languages. It covers eight major task types spanning the entire continuum of patient care across six clinical stages and 20 representative applications, including triage and referral, consultation, information extraction, diagnosis, prognosis, and billing coding, and involves 14 clinical specialties. We systematically evaluated 95 LLMs (including DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o, Gemini series, and Qwen3 series) under various inference strategies. Our results reveal substantial performance variation across model sizes, languages, natural language processing tasks, and clinical specialties. Notably, we demonstrate that open-source LLMs can achieve performance comparable to proprietary models, while medically fine-tuned LLMs based on older architectures often underperform versus updated general-purpose models. The BRIDGE and its corresponding leaderboard serve as a foundational resource and a unique reference for the development and evaluation of new LLMs in real-world clinical text understanding.\n  The BRIDGE leaderboard: https:\/\/huggingface.co\/spaces\/YLab-Open\/BRIDGE-Medical-Leaderboard"}
{"title":"A Design Framework for operationalizing Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Requirements, Tradeoffs and Challenges for its Clinical Adoption","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare, particularly in disease diagnosis, prognosis, and patient care. The increasing availability of digital medical data, such as images, omics, biosignals, and electronic health records, combined with advances in computing, has enabled AI models to approach expert-level performance. However, widespread clinical adoption remains limited, primarily due to challenges beyond technical performance, including ethical concerns, regulatory barriers, and lack of trust. To address these issues, AI systems must align with the principles of Trustworthy AI (TAI), which emphasize human agency and oversight, algorithmic robustness, privacy and data governance, transparency, bias and discrimination avoidance, and accountability. Yet, the complexity of healthcare processes (e.g., screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment) and the diversity of stakeholders (clinicians, patients, providers, regulators) complicate the integration of TAI principles. To bridge the gap between TAI theory and practical implementation, this paper proposes a design framework to support developers in embedding TAI principles into medical AI systems. Thus, for each stakeholder identified across various healthcare processes, we propose a disease-agnostic collection of requirements that medical AI systems should incorporate to adhere to the principles of TAI. Additionally, we examine the challenges and tradeoffs that may arise when applying these principles in practice. To ground the discussion, we focus on cardiovascular diseases, a field marked by both high prevalence and active AI innovation, and demonstrate how TAI principles have been applied and where key obstacles persist."}
{"title":"Temporal Entailment Pretraining for Clinical Language Models over EHR Data","abstract":"Clinical language models have achieved strong performance on downstream tasks by pretraining on domain specific corpora such as discharge summaries and medical notes. However, most approaches treat the electronic health record as a static document, neglecting the temporally-evolving and causally entwined nature of patient trajectories. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal entailment pretraining objective for language models in the clinical domain. Our method formulates EHR segments as temporally ordered sentence pairs and trains the model to determine whether a later state is entailed by, contradictory to, or neutral with respect to an earlier state. Through this temporally structured pretraining task, models learn to perform latent clinical reasoning over time, improving their ability to generalize across forecasting and diagnosis tasks. We pretrain on a large corpus derived from MIMIC IV and demonstrate state of the art results on temporal clinical QA, early warning prediction, and disease progression modeling."}
{"title":"Combating the Bucket Effect:Multi-Knowledge Alignment for Medication Recommendation","abstract":"Medication recommendation is crucial in healthcare, offering effective treatments based on patient's electronic health records (EHR). Previous studies show that integrating more medication-related knowledge improves medication representation accuracy. However, not all medications encompass multiple types of knowledge data simultaneously. For instance, some medications provide only textual descriptions without structured data. This imbalance in data availability limits the performance of existing models, a challenge we term the \"bucket effect\" in medication recommendation. Our data analysis uncovers the severity of the \"bucket effect\" in medication recommendation. To fill this gap, we introduce a cross-modal medication encoder capable of seamlessly aligning data from different modalities and propose a medication recommendation framework to integrate Multiple types of Knowledge, named MKMed. Specifically, we first pre-train a cross-modal encoder with contrastive learning on five knowledge modalities, aligning them into a unified space. Then, we combine the multi-knowledge medication representations with patient records for recommendations. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that MKMed mitigates the \"bucket effect\" in data, and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recommendation accuracy and safety."}
{"title":"Early Detection of Multidrug Resistance Using Multivariate Time Series Analysis and Interpretable Patient-Similarity Representations","abstract":"Background and Objectives: Multidrug Resistance (MDR) is a critical global health issue, causing increased hospital stays, healthcare costs, and mortality. This study proposes an interpretable Machine Learning (ML) framework for MDR prediction, aiming for both accurate inference and enhanced explainability.\n  Methods: Patients are modeled as Multivariate Time Series (MTS), capturing clinical progression and patient-to-patient interactions. Similarity among patients is quantified using MTS-based methods: descriptive statistics, Dynamic Time Warping, and Time Cluster Kernel. These similarity measures serve as inputs for MDR classification via Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, with dimensionality reduction and kernel transformations improving model performance. For explainability, patient similarity networks are constructed from these metrics. Spectral clustering and t-SNE are applied to identify MDR-related subgroups and visualize high-risk clusters, enabling insight into clinically relevant patterns.\n  Results: The framework was validated on ICU Electronic Health Records from the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada, achieving an AUC of 81%. It outperforms baseline ML and deep learning models by leveraging graph-based patient similarity. The approach identifies key risk factors -- prolonged antibiotic use, invasive procedures, co-infections, and extended ICU stays -- and reveals clinically meaningful clusters. Code and results are available at \\https:\/\/github.com\/oscarescuderoarnanz\/DM4MTS.\n  Conclusions: Patient similarity representations combined with graph-based analysis provide accurate MDR prediction and interpretable insights. This method supports early detection, risk factor identification, and patient stratification, highlighting the potential of explainable ML in critical care."}
{"title":"TarDiff: Target-Oriented Diffusion Guidance for Synthetic Electronic Health Record Time Series Generation","abstract":"Synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) time-series generation is crucial for advancing clinical machine learning models, as it helps address data scarcity by providing more training data. However, most existing approaches focus primarily on replicating statistical distributions and temporal dependencies of real-world data. We argue that fidelity to observed data alone does not guarantee better model performance, as common patterns may dominate, limiting the representation of rare but important conditions. This highlights the need for generate synthetic samples to improve performance of specific clinical models to fulfill their target outcomes. To address this, we propose TarDiff, a novel target-oriented diffusion framework that integrates task-specific influence guidance into the synthetic data generation process. Unlike conventional approaches that mimic training data distributions, TarDiff optimizes synthetic samples by quantifying their expected contribution to improving downstream model performance through influence functions. Specifically, we measure the reduction in task-specific loss induced by synthetic samples and embed this influence gradient into the reverse diffusion process, thereby steering the generation towards utility-optimized data. Evaluated on six publicly available EHR datasets, TarDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by up to 20.4% in AUPRC and 18.4% in AUROC. Our results demonstrate that TarDiff not only preserves temporal fidelity but also enhances downstream model performance, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and class imbalance in healthcare analytics."}
{"title":"Robust Causal Inference for EHR-based Studies of Point Exposures with Missingness in Eligibility Criteria","abstract":"Missingness in variables that define study eligibility criteria is a seldom addressed challenge in electronic health record (EHR)-based settings. It is typically the case that patients with incomplete eligibility information are excluded from analysis without consideration of (implicit) assumptions that are being made, leaving study conclusions subject to potential selection bias. In an effort to ascertain eligibility for more patients, researchers may look back further in time prior to study baseline, and in using outdated values of eligibility-defining covariates may inappropriately be including individuals who, unbeknownst to the researcher, fail to meet eligibility at baseline. To the best of our knowledge, however, very little work has been done to mitigate these concerns. We propose a robust and efficient estimator of the causal average treatment effect on the treated, defined in the study eligible population, in cohort studies where eligibility-defining covariates are missing at random. The approach facilitates the use of flexible machine-learning strategies for component nuisance functions while maintaining appropriate convergence rates for valid asymptotic inference. This method is directly motivated by, and applied throughout to EHR data from Kaiser Permanente to analyze differences between two common bariatric surgical interventions for long-term weight and glycemic outcomes among a cohort of severely obese patients with type II diabetes mellitus."}
{"title":"Cryptogenic stroke and migraine: using probabilistic independence and machine learning to uncover latent sources of disease from the electronic health record","abstract":"Migraine is a common but complex neurological disorder that doubles the lifetime risk of cryptogenic stroke (CS). However, this relationship remains poorly characterized, and few clinical guidelines exist to reduce this associated risk. We therefore propose a data-driven approach to extract probabilistically-independent sources from electronic health record (EHR) data and create a 10-year risk-predictive model for CS in migraine patients. These sources represent external latent variables acting on the causal graph constructed from the EHR data and approximate root causes of CS in our population. A random forest model trained on patient expressions of these sources demonstrated good accuracy (ROC 0.771) and identified the top 10 most predictive sources of CS in migraine patients. These sources revealed that pharmacologic interventions were the most important factor in minimizing CS risk in our population and identified a factor related to allergic rhinitis as a potential causative source of CS in migraine patients."}
{"title":"Large Language Model Empowered Privacy-Protected Framework for PHI Annotation in Clinical Notes","abstract":"The de-identification of private information in medical data is a crucial process to mitigate the risk of confidentiality breaches, particularly when patient personal details are not adequately removed before the release of medical records. Although rule-based and learning-based methods have been proposed, they often struggle with limited generalizability and require substantial amounts of annotated data for effective performance. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in addressing these issues due to their superior language comprehension capabilities. However, LLMs present challenges, including potential privacy risks when using commercial LLM APIs and high computational costs for deploying open-source LLMs locally. In this work, we introduce LPPA, an LLM-empowered Privacy-Protected PHI Annotation framework for clinical notes, targeting the English language. By fine-tuning LLMs locally with synthetic notes, LPPA ensures strong privacy protection and high PHI annotation accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate LPPA's effectiveness in accurately de-identifying private information, offering a scalable and efficient solution for enhancing patient privacy protection."}
{"title":"A Case Study Exploring the Current Landscape of Synthetic Medical Record Generation with Commercial LLMs","abstract":"Synthetic Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer a valuable opportunity to create privacy preserving and harmonized structured data, supporting numerous applications in healthcare. Key benefits of synthetic data include precise control over the data schema, improved fairness and representation of patient populations, and the ability to share datasets without concerns about compromising real individuals privacy. Consequently, the AI community has increasingly turned to Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic data across various domains. However, a significant challenge in healthcare is ensuring that synthetic health records reliably generalize across different hospitals, a long standing issue in the field. In this work, we evaluate the current state of commercial LLMs for generating synthetic data and investigate multiple aspects of the generation process to identify areas where these models excel and where they fall short. Our main finding from this work is that while LLMs can reliably generate synthetic health records for smaller subsets of features, they struggle to preserve realistic distributions and correlations as the dimensionality of the data increases, ultimately limiting their ability to generalize across diverse hospital settings."}
{"title":"Time-varying treatment effect models in stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trials with multiple interventions","abstract":"The traditional model specification of stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trials assumes a homogeneous treatment effect across time while adjusting for fixed-time effects. However, when treatment effects vary over time, the constant effect estimator may be biased. In the general setting of stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trials with multiple interventions, we derive the expected value of the constant effect estimator when the true treatment effects depend on exposure time periods. Applying this result to concurrent and factorial stepped wedge designs, we show that the estimator represents a weighted average of exposure-time-specific treatment effects, with weights that are not necessarily uniform across exposure periods. Extensive simulation studies reveal that ignoring time heterogeneity can result in biased estimates and poor coverage of the average treatment effect. In this study, we examine two models designed to accommodate multiple interventions with time-varying treatment effects: (1) a time-varying fixed treatment effect model, which allows treatment effects to vary by exposure time but remain fixed for each time point, and (2) a random treatment effect model, where the time-varying treatment effects are modeled as random deviations from an overall mean. In the simulations considered in this study, concurrent designs generally achieve higher power than factorial designs under a time-varying fixed treatment effect model, though the differences are modest. Finally, we apply the constant effect model and both time-varying treatment effect models to data from the Prognosticating Outcomes and Nudging Decisions in the Electronic Health Record (PONDER) trial. All three models indicate a lack of treatment effect for either intervention, though they differ in the precision of their estimates, likely due to variations in modeling assumptions."}
{"title":"Accelerating Clinical NLP at Scale with a Hybrid Framework with Reduced GPU Demands: A Case Study in Dementia Identification","abstract":"Clinical natural language processing (NLP) is increasingly in demand in both clinical research and operational practice. However, most of the state-of-the-art solutions are transformers-based and require high computational resources, limiting their accessibility. We propose a hybrid NLP framework that integrates rule-based filtering, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, and a BERT-based model to improve efficiency while maintaining accuracy. We applied this framework in a dementia identification case study involving 4.9 million veterans with incident hypertension, analyzing 2.1 billion clinical notes. At the patient level, our method achieved a precision of 0.90, a recall of 0.84, and an F1-score of 0.87. Additionally, this NLP approach identified over three times as many dementia cases as structured data methods. All processing was completed in approximately two weeks using a single machine with dual A40 GPUs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of hybrid NLP solutions for large-scale clinical text analysis, making state-of-the-art methods more accessible to healthcare organizations with limited computational resources."}
{"title":"A cautionary note for plasmode simulation studies in the setting of causal inference","abstract":"Plasmode simulation has become an important tool for evaluating the operating characteristics of different statistical methods in complex settings, such as pharmacoepidemiological studies of treatment effectiveness using electronic health records (EHR) data. These studies provide insight into how estimator performance is impacted by challenges including rare events, small sample size, etc., that can indicate which among a set of methods performs best in a real-world dataset. Plasmode simulation combines data resampled from a real-world dataset with synthetic data to generate a known truth for an estimand in realistic data. There are different potential plasmode strategies currently in use. We compare two popular plasmode simulation frameworks. We provide numerical evidence and a theoretical result, which shows that one of these frameworks can cause certain estimators to incorrectly appear overly biased with lower than nominal confidence interval coverage. Detailed simulation studies using both synthetic and real-world EHR data demonstrate that these pitfalls remain at large sample sizes and when analyzing data from a randomized controlled trial. We conclude with guidance for the choice of a plasmode simulation approach that maintains good theoretical properties to allow a fair evaluation of statistical methods while also maintaining the desired similarity to real data."}
{"title":"A Large-Language Model Framework for Relative Timeline Extraction from PubMed Case Reports","abstract":"Timing of clinical events is central to characterization of patient trajectories, enabling analyses such as process tracing, forecasting, and causal reasoning. However, structured electronic health records capture few data elements critical to these tasks, while clinical reports lack temporal localization of events in structured form. We present a system that transforms case reports into textual time series-structured pairs of textual events and timestamps. We contrast manual and large language model (LLM) annotations (n=320 and n=390 respectively) of ten randomly-sampled PubMed open-access (PMOA) case reports (N=152,974) and assess inter-LLM agreement (n=3,103; N=93). We find that the LLM models have moderate event recall(O1-preview: 0.80) but high temporal concordance among identified events (O1-preview: 0.95). By establishing the task, annotation, and assessment systems, and by demonstrating high concordance, this work may serve as a benchmark for leveraging the PMOA corpus for temporal analytics."}
{"title":"DeepSelective: Interpretable Prognosis Prediction via Feature Selection and Compression in EHR Data","abstract":"The rapid accumulation of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has transformed healthcare by providing valuable data that enhance clinical predictions and diagnoses. While conventional machine learning models have proven effective, they often lack robust representation learning and depend heavily on expert-crafted features. Although deep learning offers powerful solutions, it is often criticized for its lack of interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose DeepSelective, a novel end to end deep learning framework for predicting patient prognosis using EHR data, with a strong emphasis on enhancing model interpretability. DeepSelective combines data compression techniques with an innovative feature selection approach, integrating custom-designed modules that work together to improve both accuracy and interpretability. Our experiments demonstrate that DeepSelective not only enhances predictive accuracy but also significantly improves interpretability, making it a valuable tool for clinical decision-making.

{"title":"Paging Dr. GPT: Extracting Information from Clinical Notes to Enhance Patient Predictions","abstract":"There is a long history of building predictive models in healthcare using tabular data from electronic medical records. However, these models fail to extract the information found in unstructured clinical notes, which document diagnosis, treatment, progress, medications, and care plans. In this study, we investigate how answers generated by GPT-4o-mini (ChatGPT) to simple clinical questions about patients, when given access to the patient's discharge summary, can support patient-level mortality prediction. Using data from 14,011 first-time admissions to the Coronary Care or Cardiovascular Intensive Care Units in the MIMIC-IV Note dataset, we implement a transparent framework that uses GPT responses as input features in logistic regression models. Our findings demonstrate that GPT-based models alone can outperform models trained on standard tabular data, and that combining both sources of information yields even greater predictive power, increasing AUC by an average of 5.1 percentage points and increasing positive predictive value by 29.9 percent for the highest-risk decile. These results highlight the value of integrating large language models (LLMs) into clinical prediction tasks and underscore the broader potential for using LLMs in any domain where unstructured text data remains an underutilized resource."}
{"title":"Foundation models for electronic health records: representation dynamics and transferability","abstract":"Foundation models (FMs) trained on electronic health records (EHRs) have shown strong performance on a range of clinical prediction tasks. However, adapting these models to local health systems remains challenging due to limited data availability and resource constraints. In this study, we investigated what these models learn and evaluated the transferability of an FM trained on MIMIC-IV to an institutional EHR dataset at the University of Chicago Medical Center. We assessed their ability to identify outlier patients and examined representation-space patient trajectories in relation to future clinical outcomes. We also evaluated the performance of supervised fine-tuned classifiers on both source and target datasets. Our findings offer insights into the adaptability of FMs across different healthcare systems, highlight considerations for their effective implementation, and provide an empirical analysis of the underlying factors that contribute to their predictive performance."}
{"title":"CliniChat: A Multi-Source Knowledge-Driven Framework for Clinical Interview Dialogue Reconstruction and Evaluation","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) hold great promise for assisting clinical interviews due to their fluent interactive capabilities and extensive medical knowledge. However, the lack of high-quality interview dialogue data and widely accepted evaluation methods has significantly impeded this process. So we propose CliniChat, a framework that integrates multi-source knowledge to enable LLMs to simulate real-world clinical interviews. It consists of two modules: Clini-Recon and Clini-Eval, each responsible for reconstructing and evaluating interview dialogues, respectively. By incorporating three sources of knowledge, Clini-Recon transforms clinical notes into systematic, professional, and empathetic interview dialogues. Clini-Eval combines a comprehensive evaluation metric system with a two-phase automatic evaluation approach, enabling LLMs to assess interview performance like experts. We contribute MedQA-Dialog, a high-quality synthetic interview dialogue dataset, and CliniChatGLM, a model specialized for clinical interviews. Experimental results demonstrate that CliniChatGLM's interview capabilities undergo a comprehensive upgrade, particularly in history-taking, achieving state-of-the-art performance."}
{"title":"MedRep: Medical Concept Representation for General Electronic Health Record Foundation Models","abstract":"Electronic health record (EHR) foundation models have been an area ripe for exploration with their improved performance in various medical tasks. Despite the rapid advances, there exists a fundamental limitation: Processing unseen medical codes out of vocabulary. This problem limits the generalizability of EHR foundation models and the integration of models trained with different vocabularies. To alleviate this problem, we propose a set of novel medical concept representations (MedRep) for EHR foundation models based on the observational medical outcome partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM). For concept representation learning, we enrich the information of each concept with a minimal definition through large language model (LLM) prompts and complement the text-based representations through the graph ontology of OMOP vocabulary. Our approach outperforms the vanilla EHR foundation model and the model with a previously introduced medical code tokenizer in diverse prediction tasks. We also demonstrate the generalizability of MedRep through external validation."}

ChronoFormer integrates temporal embeddings, hierarchical attention mechanisms, and domain specific masking techniques. Extensive experiments conducted on three benchmark tasks mortality prediction, readmission prediction, and long term comorbidity onset demonstrate substantial improvements over current state of the art methods. Furthermore, detailed analyses of attention patterns underscore ChronoFormer's capability to capture clinically meaningful long range temporal relationships."}
{"title":"A Multi-Phase Analysis of Blood Culture Stewardship: Machine Learning Prediction, Expert Recommendation Assessment, and LLM Automation","abstract":"Blood cultures are often over ordered without clear justification, straining healthcare resources and contributing to inappropriate antibiotic use pressures worsened by the global shortage. In study of 135483 emergency department (ED) blood culture orders, we developed machine learning (ML) models to predict the risk of bacteremia using structured electronic health record (EHR) data and provider notes via a large language model (LLM). The structured models AUC improved from 0.76 to 0.79 with note embeddings and reached 0.81 with added diagnosis codes. Compared to an expert recommendation framework applied by human reviewers and an LLM-based pipeline, our ML approach offered higher specificity without compromising sensitivity. The recommendation framework achieved sensitivity 86%, specificity 57%, while the LLM maintained high sensitivity (96%) but over classified negatives, reducing specificity (16%). These findings demonstrate that ML models integrating structured and unstructured data can outperform consensus recommendations, enhancing diagnostic stewardship beyond existing standards of care."}
{"title":"Evaluation of the impact of expert knowledge: How decision support scores impact the effectiveness of automatic knowledge-driven feature engineering (aKDFE)","abstract":"Adverse Drug Events (ADEs), harmful medication effects, pose significant healthcare challenges, impacting patient safety and costs. This study evaluates automatic Knowledge-Driven Feature Engineering (aKDFE) for improved ADE prediction from Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, comparing it with automated event-based Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). We investigated how incorporating domain-specific ADE risk scores for prolonged heart QT interval, extracted from the Janusmed Riskprofile (Janusmed) Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS), affects prediction performance using EHR data and medication handling events. Results indicate that, while aKDFE step 1 (event-based feature generation) alone did not significantly improve ADE prediction performance, aKDFE step 2 (patient-centric transformation) enhances the prediction performance. High Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) values suggest strong feature correlations to the outcome, aligning with the predictive power of patients' prior healthcare history for ADEs. Statistical analysis did not confirm that incorporating the Janusmed information (i) risk scores and (ii) medication route of administration into the model's feature set enhanced predictive performance. However, the patient-centric transformation applied by aKDFE proved to be a highly effective feature engineering approach. Limitations include a single-project focus, potential bias from machine learning pipeline methods, and reliance on AUROC. In conclusion, aKDFE, particularly with patient-centric transformation, improves ADE prediction from EHR data. Future work will explore attention-based models, event feature sequences, and automatic methods for incorporating domain knowledge into the aKDFE framework."}

{"title":"An AI-powered Public Health Automated Kiosk System for Personalized Care: An Experimental Pilot Study","abstract":"Background: The HERMES Kiosk (Healthcare Enhanced Recommendations through Artificial Intelligence & Expertise System) is designed to provide personalized Over-the-Counter (OTC) medication recommendations, addressing the limitations of traditional health kiosks. It integrates an advanced GAMENet model enhanced with Graph Attention Networks (GAT) and Multi-Head Cross-Attention (MHCA) while ensuring user privacy through federated learning. This paper outlines the conceptual design and architecture of HERMES, with a focus on deployment in high-traffic public areas. Methods: HERMES analyzes self-reported symptoms and anonymized medical histories using AI algorithms to generate context-aware OTC medication recommendations. The system was initially trained using Electronic Health Records (EHR) from the MIMIC-III dataset (6,350 patients) and Drug-Drug Interaction (DDI) data from the TWOSIDES database, incorporating the top 90 severity DDI types. Real-time DDI checks and ATC-mapped drug codes further improve safety. The kiosk is designed for accessibility, offering multilingual support, large fonts, voice commands, and Braille compatibility. A built-in health education library promotes preventive care and health literacy. A survey was conducted among 10 medical professionals to evaluate its potential applications in medicine. Results: Preliminary results show that the enhanced GAMENet model achieved a Precision-Recall AUC (PRAUC) of 0.74, outperforming the original model. These findings suggest a strong potential for delivering accurate and secure healthcare recommendations in public settings. Conclusion: HERMES demonstrates how AI-driven, privacy-preserving kiosks can enhance public health access, empower users, and alleviate burdens on healthcare systems. Future work will focus on real-world deployment, usability testing, and scalability for broader adoption."}
{"title":"Domain Adaptation Under MNAR Missingness","abstract":"Current domain adaptation methods under missingness shift are restricted to Missing At Random (MAR) missingness mechanisms. However, in many real-world examples, the MAR assumption may be too restrictive. When covariates are Missing Not At Random (MNAR) in both source and target data, the common covariate shift solutions, including importance weighting, are not directly applicable. We show that under reasonable assumptions, the problem of MNAR missingness shift can be reduced to an imputation problem. This allows us to leverage recent methodological developments in both the traditional statistics and machine\/deep-learning literature for MNAR imputation to develop a novel domain adaptation procedure for MNAR missingness shift. We further show that our proposed procedure can be extended to handle simultaneous MNAR missingness and covariate shifts. We apply our procedure to Electronic Health Record (EHR) data from two hospitals in south and northeast regions of the US. In this setting we expect different hospital networks and regions to serve different populations and to have different procedures, practices, and software for inputting and recording data, causing simultaneous missingness and covariate shifts."}
{"title":"Multi-Task Learning for Extracting Menstrual Characteristics from Clinical Notes","abstract":"Menstrual health is a critical yet often overlooked aspect of women's healthcare. Despite its clinical relevance, detailed data on menstrual characteristics is rarely available in structured medical records. To address this gap, we propose a novel Natural Language Processing pipeline to extract key menstrual cycle attributes -- dysmenorrhea, regularity, flow volume, and intermenstrual bleeding. Our approach utilizes the GatorTron model with Multi-Task Prompt-based Learning, enhanced by a hybrid retrieval preprocessing step to identify relevant text segments. It out- performs baseline methods, achieving an average F1-score of 90% across all menstrual characteristics, despite being trained on fewer than 100 annotated clinical notes. The retrieval step consistently improves performance across all approaches, allowing the model to focus on the most relevant segments of lengthy clinical notes. These results show that combining multi-task learning with retrieval improves generalization and performance across menstrual charac- teristics, advancing automated extraction from clinical notes and supporting women's health research."}
{"title":"Comparing representations of long clinical texts for the task of patient note-identification","abstract":"In this paper, we address the challenge of patient-note identification, which involves accurately matching an anonymized clinical note to its corresponding patient, represented by a set of related notes. This task has broad applications, including duplicate records detection and patient similarity analysis, which require robust patient-level representations. We explore various embedding methods, including Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN), three-level Hierarchical Transformer Networks (HTN), LongFormer, and advanced BERT-based models, focusing on their ability to process mediumto-long clinical texts effectively. Additionally, we evaluate different pooling strategies (mean, max, and mean_max) for aggregating wordlevel embeddings into patient-level representations and we examine the impact of sliding windows on model performance. Our results indicate that BERT-based embeddings outperform traditional and hierarchical models, particularly in processing lengthy clinical notes and capturing nuanced patient representations. Among the pooling strategies, mean_max pooling consistently yields the best results, highlighting its ability to capture critical features from clinical notes. Furthermore, the reproduction of our results on both MIMIC dataset and Necker hospital data warehouse illustrates the generalizability of these approaches to real-world applications, emphasizing the importance of both embedding methods and aggregation strategies in optimizing patient-note identification and enhancing patient-level modeling."}
{"title":"Integrating Large Language Models with Human Expertise for Disease Detection in Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Objective: Electronic health records (EHR) are widely available to complement administrative data-based disease surveillance and healthcare performance evaluation. Defining conditions from EHR is labour-intensive and requires extensive manual labelling of disease outcomes. This study developed an efficient strategy based on advanced large language models to identify multiple conditions from EHR clinical notes. Methods: We linked a cardiac registry cohort in 2015 with an EHR system in Alberta, Canada. We developed a pipeline that leveraged a generative large language model (LLM) to analyze, understand, and interpret EHR notes by prompts based on specific diagnosis, treatment management, and clinical guidelines. The pipeline was applied to detect acute myocardial infarction (AMI), diabetes, and hypertension. The performance was compared against clinician-validated diagnoses as the reference standard and widely adopted International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes-based methods. Results: The study cohort accounted for 3,088 patients and 551,095 clinical notes. The prevalence was 55.4%, 27.7%, 65.9% and for AMI, diabetes, and hypertension, respectively. The performance of the LLM-based pipeline for detecting conditions varied: AMI had 88% sensitivity, 63% specificity, and 77% positive predictive value (PPV); diabetes had 91% sensitivity, 86% specificity, and 71% PPV; and hypertension had 94% sensitivity, 32% specificity, and 72% PPV. Compared with ICD codes, the LLM-based method demonstrated improved sensitivity and negative predictive value across all conditions. The monthly percentage trends from the detected cases by LLM and reference standard showed consistent patterns."}
{"title":"Assessing Validity of ICD-10 Administrative Data in Coding Comorbidities","abstract":"Objectives: Administrative data is commonly used to inform chronic disease prevalence and support health informatics research. This study assessed the validity of coding comorbidity in the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) administrative data. Methods: We analyzed three chart review cohorts (4,008 patients in 2003, 3,045 in 2015, and 9,024 in 2022) in Alberta, Canada. Nurse reviewers assessed the presence of 17 clinical conditions using a consistent protocol. The reviews were linked with administrative data using unique identifiers. We compared the accuracy in coding comorbidity by ICD-10, using chart review data as the reference standard. Results: Our findings showed that the mean difference in prevalence between chart reviews and ICD-10 for these 17 conditions was 2.1% in 2003, 7.6% in 2015, and 6.3% in 2022. Some conditions were relatively stable, such as diabetes (1.9%, 2.1%, and 1.1%) and metastatic cancer (0.3%, 1.1%, and 0.4%). For these 17 conditions, the sensitivity ranged from 39.6-85.1% in 2003, 1.3-85.2% in 2015, and 3.0-89.7% in 2022. The C-statistics for predicting in-hospital mortality using comorbidities by ICD-10 were 0.84 in 2003, 0.81 in 2015, and 0.78 in 2022. Discussion: The under-coding could be primarily due to the increase of hospital patient volumes and the limited time allocated to coders. There is a potential to develop artificial intelligence methods based on electronic health records to support coding practices and improve coding quality. Conclusion: Comorbidities were increasingly under-coded over 20 years. The validity of ICD-10 decreased but remained relatively stable for certain conditions mandated for coding. The under-coding exerted minimal impact on in-hospital mortality prediction."}
{"title":"Extracting Patient History from Clinical Text: A Comparative Study of Clinical Large Language Models","abstract":"Extracting medical history entities (MHEs) related to a patient's chief complaint (CC), history of present illness (HPI), and past, family, and social history (PFSH) helps structure free-text clinical notes into standardized EHRs, streamlining downstream tasks like continuity of care, medical coding, and quality metrics. Fine-tuned clinical large language models (cLLMs) can assist in this process while ensuring the protection of sensitive data via on-premises deployment. This study evaluates the performance of cLLMs in recognizing CC\/HPI\/PFSH-related MHEs and examines how note characteristics impact model accuracy. We annotated 1,449 MHEs across 61 outpatient-related clinical notes from the MTSamples repository. To recognize these entities, we fine-tuned seven state-of-the-art cLLMs. Additionally, we assessed the models' performance when enhanced by integrating, problems, tests, treatments, and other basic medical entities (BMEs). We compared the performance of these models against GPT-4o in a zero-shot setting. To further understand the textual characteristics affecting model accuracy, we conducted an error analysis focused on note length, entity length, and segmentation. The cLLMs showed potential in reducing the time required for extracting MHEs by over 20%. However, detecting many types of MHEs remained challenging due to their polysemous nature and the frequent involvement of non-medical vocabulary. Fine-tuned GatorTron and GatorTronS, two of the most extensively trained cLLMs, demonstrated the highest performance. Integrating pre-identified BME information improved model performance for certain entities. Regarding the impact of textual characteristics on model performance, we found that longer entities were harder to identify, note length did not correlate with a higher error rate, and well-organized segments with headings are beneficial for the extraction."}
{"title":"TRACE: Intra-visit Clinical Event Nowcasting via Effective Patient Trajectory Encoding","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHR) have become a valuable resource for a wide range of predictive tasks in healthcare. However, existing approaches have largely focused on inter-visit event predictions, overlooking the importance of intra-visit nowcasting, which provides prompt clinical insights during an ongoing patient visit. To address this gap, we introduce the task of laboratory measurement prediction within a hospital visit. We study the laboratory data that, however, remained underexplored in previous work. We propose TRACE, a Transformer-based model designed for clinical event nowcasting by encoding patient trajectories. TRACE effectively handles long sequences and captures temporal dependencies through a novel timestamp embedding that integrates decay properties and periodic patterns of data. Additionally, we introduce a smoothed mask for denoising, improving the robustness of the model. Experiments on two large-scale electronic health record datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms previous methods, highlighting its potential for improving patient care through more accurate laboratory measurement nowcasting.

{"title":"Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission with clinical notes and EHR information","abstract":"High hospital readmission rates are associated with significant costs and health risks for patients. Therefore, it is critical to develop predictive models that can support clinicians to determine whether or not a patient will return to the hospital in a relatively short period of time (e.g, 30-days). Nowadays, it is possible to collect both structured (electronic health records - EHR) and unstructured information (clinical notes) about a patient hospital event, all potentially containing relevant information for a predictive model. However, their integration is challenging. In this work we explore the combination of clinical notes and EHRs to predict 30-day hospital readmissions. We address the representation of the various types of information available in the EHR data, as well as exploring LLMs to characterize the clinical notes. We collect both information sources as the nodes of a graph neural network (GNN). Our model achieves an AUROC of 0.72 and a balanced accuracy of 66.7\\%, highlighting the importance of combining the multimodal information."}
{"title":"Demographic Factors Associated with Triage Acuity, Admission and Length of Stay During Adult Emergency Department Visits","abstract":"Objective: To describe the association of demographic factors with triage acuity, hospital admission rates, and length of stay (LOS) for adult patients in the emergency department (ED). Methods: We performed a retrospective cross-sectional analysis using publicly available electronic health records describing visits to the ED of a single US medical center during 2011-2019. The primary exposures of interest were self-reported gender, race\/ethnicity, and age. The outcomes studied were triage acuity, admission to hospital, and LOS in the ED. Odds ratios were calculated using propensity-score matching. Analyses were adjusted for confounding variables, including vital signs and diagnoses. Key Results: Black patients were more likely than White patients to experience long stays before admission but not before discharge. Men were more likely than women to be triaged as urgent or admitted, and had shorter stays. Patients over 30 were likelier to be triaged as urgent or admitted, but had longer stays."}
{"title":"DynaGraph: Interpretable Multi-Label Prediction from EHRs via Dynamic Graph Learning and Contrastive Augmentation","abstract":"Learning from longitudinal electronic health records is limited if it does not capture the temporal trajectories of the patient's state in a clinical setting. Graph models allow us to capture the hidden dependencies of the multivariate time-series when the graphs are constructed in a similar dynamic manner. Previous dynamic graph models require a pre-defined and\/or static graph structure, which is unknown in most cases, or they only capture the spatial relations between the features. Furthermore in healthcare, the interpretability of the model is an essential requirement to build trust with clinicians. In addition to previously proposed attention mechanisms, there has not been an interpretable dynamic graph framework for data from multivariate electronic health records (EHRs). Here, we propose DynaGraph, an end-to-end interpretable contrastive graph model that learns the dynamics of multivariate time-series EHRs as part of optimisation. We validate our model in four real-world clinical datasets, ranging from primary care to secondary care settings with broad demographics, in challenging settings where tasks are imbalanced and multi-labelled. Compared to state-of-the-art models, DynaGraph achieves significant improvements in balanced accuracy and sensitivity over the nearest complex competitors in time-series or dynamic graph modelling across three ICU and one primary care datasets. Through a pseudo-attention approach to graph construction, our model also indicates the importance of clinical covariates over time, providing means for clinical validation."}
{"title":"Leveraging LLMs for Predicting Unknown Diagnoses from Clinical Notes","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) often lack explicit links between medications and diagnoses, making clinical decision-making and research more difficult. Even when links exist, diagnosis lists may be incomplete, especially during early patient visits. Discharge summaries tend to provide more complete information, which can help infer accurate diagnoses, especially with the help of large language models (LLMs). This study investigates whether LLMs can predict implicitly mentioned diagnoses from clinical notes and link them to corresponding medications. We address two research questions: (1) Does majority voting across diverse LLM configurations outperform the best single configuration in diagnosis prediction? (2) How sensitive is majority voting accuracy to LLM hyperparameters such as temperature, top-p, and summary length? To evaluate, we created a new dataset of 240 expert-annotated medication-diagnosis pairs from 20 MIMIC-IV notes. Using GPT-3.5 Turbo, we ran 18 prompting configurations across short and long summary lengths, generating 8568 test cases. Results show that majority voting achieved 75 percent accuracy, outperforming the best single configuration at 66 percent. No single hyperparameter setting dominated, but combining deterministic, balanced, and exploratory strategies improved performance. Shorter summaries generally led to higher accuracy.In conclusion, ensemble-style majority voting with diverse LLM configurations improves diagnosis prediction in EHRs and offers a promising method to link medications and diagnoses in clinical texts."}
{"title":"A Quantitative Approach to Evaluating Open-Source EHR Systems for Indian Healthcare","abstract":"The increasing use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has emphasized the need for standardization and interoperability in healthcare data management. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, has introduced the Electronic Health Record Minimum Data Set (EHRMDS) to facilitate uniformity in clinical documentation. However, the compatibility of Open-Source Electronic Health Record Systems (OS-EHRS) with EHRMDS remains largely unexplored. This study conducts a systematic assessment of the alignment between EHRMDS and commonly utilized OS-EHRS to determine the most appropriate system for healthcare environments in India. A quantitative closeness analysis was performed by comparing the metadata elements of EHRMDS with those of 10 selected OS-EHRS. Using crosswalk methodologies based on syntactic and semantic similarity, the study measured the extent of metadata alignment. Results indicate that OpenEMR exhibits the highest compatibility with EHRMDS, covering 73.81% of its metadata elements, while OpenClinic shows the least alignment at 33.33%. Additionally, the analysis identified 47 metadata elements present in OS-EHRS but absent in EHRMDS, suggesting the need for an extended metadata schema. By bridging gaps in clinical metadata, this study contributes to enhancing the interoperability of EHR systems in India. The findings provide valuable insights for healthcare policymakers and organizations seeking to adopt OS-EHRS aligned with national standards. Keywords.

{"title":"Sensitivity analysis for nonignorable missing values in blended analysis framework: a study on the effect of bariatric surgery via electronic health records","abstract":"This paper establishes a series of sensitivity analyses to investigate the impact of missing values in the electronic health records (EHR) that are possibly missing not at random (MNAR). EHRs have gained tremendous interest due to their cost-effectiveness, but their employment for research involves numerous challenges, such as selection bias due to missing data. The blended analysis has been suggested to overcome such challenges, which decomposes the data provenance into a sequence of sub-mechanisms and uses a combination of inverse-probability weighting (IPW) and multiple imputation (MI) under missing at random assumption (MAR). In this paper, we expand the blended analysis under the MNAR assumption and present a sensitivity analysis framework to investigate the effect of MNAR missing values on the analysis results. We illustrate the performance of my proposed framework via numerical studies and conclude with strategies for interpreting the results of sensitivity analyses.

Despite clear benefits, they remain unpopular among healthcare professionals and present significant challenges. Positioned at the intersection of Health Information Systems studies, Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW), Service Design, and Participatory Design (PD), our research investigates how involving users in the co-design of new EHR components within a dedicated hospital space can transform healthcare practices. Through participatory co-design methodologies, including ethnographic observation, collaborative workshops, and realistic simulations, we identify the material and interactional elements essential for rebalancing power dynamics between users and designers. This project contributes to rethinking traditional EHR design approaches, embedding design practice into systemic transformation to genuinely meet healthcare professionals' needs."}
{"title":"Natural Language Processing for Electronic Health Records in Scandinavian Languages: Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish","abstract":"Background: Clinical natural language processing (NLP) refers to the use of computational methods for extracting, processing, and analyzing unstructured clinical text data, and holds a huge potential to transform healthcare in various clinical tasks. Objective: The study aims to perform a systematic review to comprehensively assess and analyze the state-of-the-art NLP methods for the mainland Scandinavian clinical text. Method: A literature search was conducted in various online databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, ACM digital library, and IEEE Xplore between December 2022 and February 2024. Further, relevant references to the included articles were also used to solidify our search. The final pool includes articles that conducted clinical NLP in the mainland Scandinavian languages and were published in English between 2010 and 2024. Results: Out of the 113 articles, 18% (n=21) focus on Norwegian clinical text, 64% (n=72) on Swedish, 10% (n=11) on Danish, and 8% (n=9) focus on more than one language. Generally, the review identified positive developments across the region despite some observable gaps and disparities between the languages. There are substantial disparities in the level of adoption of transformer-based models. In essential tasks such as de-identification, there is significantly less research activity focusing on Norwegian and Danish compared to Swedish text. Further, the review identified a low level of sharing resources such as data, experimentation code, pre-trained models, and rate of adaptation and transfer learning in the region. Conclusion: The review presented a comprehensive assessment of the state-of-the-art Clinical NLP for electronic health records (EHR) text in mainland Scandinavian languages and, highlighted the potential barriers and challenges that hinder the rapid advancement of the field in the region."}
{"title":"Experience Retrieval-Augmentation with Electronic Health Records Enables Accurate Discharge QA","abstract":"To improve the reliability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in clinical applications, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is extensively applied to provide factual medical knowledge. However, beyond general medical knowledge from open-ended datasets, clinical case-based knowledge is also critical for effective medical reasoning, as it provides context grounded in real-world patient experiences.Motivated by this, we propose Experience Retrieval-Augmentation ExpRAG framework based on Electronic Health Record(EHR), aiming to offer the relevant context from other patients' discharge reports. ExpRAG performs retrieval through a coarse-to-fine process, utilizing an EHR-based report ranker to efficiently identify similar patients, followed by an experience retriever to extract task-relevant content for enhanced medical reasoning.To evaluate ExpRAG, we introduce DischargeQA, a clinical QA dataset with 1,280 discharge-related questions across diagnosis, medication, and instruction tasks. Each problem is generated using EHR data to ensure realistic and challenging scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ExpRAG consistently outperforms a text-based ranker, achieving an average relative improvement of 5.2%, highlighting the importance of case-based knowledge for medical reasoning."}
{"title":"MedPlan:A Two-Stage RAG-Based System for Personalized Medical Plan Generation","abstract":"Despite recent success in applying large language models (LLMs) to electronic health records (EHR), most systems focus primarily on assessment rather than treatment planning. We identify three critical limitations in current approaches: they generate treatment plans in a single pass rather than following the sequential reasoning process used by clinicians; they rarely incorporate patient-specific historical context; and they fail to effectively distinguish between subjective and objective clinical information. Motivated by the SOAP methodology (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan), we introduce \\ours{}, a novel framework that structures LLM reasoning to align with real-life clinician workflows. Our approach employs a two-stage architecture that first generates a clinical assessment based on patient symptoms and objective data, then formulates a structured treatment plan informed by this assessment and enriched with patient-specific information through retrieval-augmented generation. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our method significantly outperforms baseline approaches in both assessment accuracy and treatment plan quality."}
{"title":"Launching Insights: A Pilot Study on Leveraging Real-World Observational Data from the Mayo Clinic Platform to Advance Clinical Research","abstract":"Backgrounds: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare, yet translating AI models from theoretical frameworks to real-world clinical applications remains challenging.

{"title":"A Vector-Quantized Foundation Model for Patient Behavior Monitoring","abstract":"Foundation models have achieved remarkable success across various domains, yet their adoption in healthcare remains limited. While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of foundation models for patient behavior monitoring through personal digital devices remains underexplored. The data generated by these devices are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel foundation model based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder, specifically designed to process real-world data from smartphones and wearable devices. We leveraged the discrete latent representation of this model to effectively perform two downstream tasks, suicide risk assessment and emotional state prediction, on different held-out clinical cohorts without the need of fine-tuning. We also highlight the existence of a trade-off between discrete and continuous latent structures, suggesting that hybrid models may be optimal for balancing accuracy across various supervised and unsupervised tasks."}
{"title":"LLM-Match: An Open-Sourced Patient Matching Model Based on Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation","abstract":"Patient matching is the process of linking patients to appropriate clinical trials by accurately identifying and matching their medical records with trial eligibility criteria. We propose LLM-Match, a novel framework for patient matching leveraging fine-tuned open-source large language models. Our approach consists of four key components. First, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module extracts relevant patient context from a vast pool of electronic health records (EHRs). Second, a prompt generation module constructs input prompts by integrating trial eligibility criteria (both inclusion and exclusion criteria), patient context, and system instructions. Third, a fine-tuning module with a classification head optimizes the model parameters using structured prompts and ground-truth labels. Fourth, an evaluation module assesses the fine-tuned model's performance on the testing datasets. We evaluated LLM-Match on four open datasets - n2c2, SIGIR, TREC 2021, and TREC 2022 - using open-source models, comparing it against TrialGPT, Zero-Shot, and GPT-4-based closed models. LLM-Match outperformed all baselines."}

{"title":"A Doubly Robust Instrumental Variable Approach for Estimating Average Treatment Effects in Time-to-Event Data with Unmeasured Confounding: Application to Real-World Data on ICU Patients with Septic Shock","abstract":"Motivated by conflicting conclusions regarding hydrocortisone's treatment effect on ICU patients with vasopressor-dependent septic shock, we developed a novel instrumental variable (IV) estimator to assess the average treatment effect (ATE) in time-to-event data. In real-world data, IV methods are widely used for estimating causal treatment effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding, but existing approaches for time-to-event outcomes are often constrained by strong parametric assumptions and lack desired statistical properties. Based on our derived the efficient influence function (EIF), the proposed estimator possesses double robustness and achieves asymptotic efficiency. It is also flexible to accommodate machine learning models for outcome, treatment, instrument, and censoring for handling complex real-world data. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate its double robustness, asymptotic normality, and ideal performance in complex data settings. Using electronic health records (EHR) from ICU patients, we identified physician preferences for prescribing hydrocortisone as the IV to evaluate the treatment effect of hydrocortisone on mortality. Our analysis shows no significant benefit or harm of hydrocortisone on these patients. Applying the proposed doubly robust IV method provides reliable estimates in the presence of unmeasured confounders and offers clinicians with valuable evidence-based guidance for prescribing decisions."}
{"title":"A Transformer-based survival model for prediction of all-cause mortality in heart failure patients: a multi-cohort study","abstract":"We developed and validated TRisk, a Transformer-based AI model predicting 36-month mortality in heart failure patients by analysing temporal patient journeys from UK electronic health records (EHR). Our study included 403,534 heart failure patients (ages 40-90) from 1,418 English general practices, with 1,063 practices for model derivation and 355 for external validation. TRisk was compared against the MAGGIC-EHR model across various patient subgroups. With median follow-up of 9 months, TRisk achieved a concordance index of 0.845 (95% confidence interval: [0.841, 0.849]), significantly outperforming MAGGIC-EHR's 0.728 (0.723, 0.733) for predicting 36-month all-cause mortality. TRisk showed more consistent performance across sex, age, and baseline characteristics, suggesting less bias. We successfully adapted TRisk to US hospital data through transfer learning, achieving a C-index of 0.802 (0.789, 0.816) with 21,767 patients. Explainability analyses revealed TRisk captured established risk factors while identifying underappreciated predictors like cancers and hepatic failure that were important across both cohorts. Notably, cancers maintained strong prognostic value even a decade after diagnosis. TRisk demonstrated well-calibrated mortality prediction across both healthcare systems. Our findings highlight the value of tracking longitudinal health profiles and revealed risk factors not included in previous expert-driven models."}
{"title":"Integrating Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval Augmented Generation Enhances Rare Disease Diagnosis from Clinical Notes","abstract":"Background: Several studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle with phenotype-driven gene prioritization for rare diseases. These studies typically use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to prompt foundation models like GPT and LLaMA to predict candidate genes. However, in real-world settings, foundation models are not optimized for domain-specific tasks like clinical diagnosis, yet inputs are unstructured clinical notes rather than standardized terms. How LLMs can be instructed to predict candidate genes or disease diagnosis from unstructured clinical notes remains a major challenge. Methods: We introduce RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG, two methods that combine Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze clinical notes. A five-question CoT protocol mimics expert reasoning, while RAG retrieves data from sources like HPO and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man). We evaluated these approaches on rare disease datasets, including 5,980 Phenopacket-derived notes, 255 literature-based narratives, and 220 in-house clinical notes from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Results: We found that recent foundations models, including Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, outperformed earlier versions such as Llama 2 and GPT-3.5. We also showed that RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG both outperform foundation models in candidate gene prioritization from clinical notes; in particular, both methods with DeepSeek backbone resulted in a top-10 gene accuracy of over 40% on Phenopacket-derived clinical notes. RAG-driven CoT works better for high-quality notes, where early retrieval can anchor the subsequent reasoning steps in domain-specific evidence, while CoT-driven RAG has advantage when processing lengthy and noisy notes."}
{"title":"Applications of Large Language Model Reasoning in Feature Generation","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing through their state of art reasoning capabilities. This paper explores the convergence of LLM reasoning techniques and feature generation for machine learning tasks. We examine four key reasoning approaches: Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, and Thought Space Exploration. Our analysis reveals how these approaches can be used to identify effective feature generation rules without having to manually specify search spaces. The paper categorizes LLM-based feature generation methods across various domains including finance, healthcare, and text analytics. LLMs can extract key information from clinical notes and radiology reports in healthcare, by enabling more efficient data utilization. In finance, LLMs facilitate text generation, summarization, and entity extraction from complex documents. We analyze evaluation methodologies for assessing feature quality and downstream performance, with particular attention to OCTree's decision tree reasoning approach that provides language-based feedback for iterative improvements. Current challenges include hallucination, computational efficiency, and domain adaptation. As of March 2025, emerging approaches include inference-time compute scaling, reinforcement learning, and supervised fine-tuning with model distillation. Future directions point toward multimodal feature generation, self-improving systems, and neuro-symbolic approaches. This paper provides a detailed overview of an emerging field that promises to automate and enhance feature engineering through language model reasoning."}
{"title":"Unlocking Health Insights with SDoH Data: A Comprehensive Open-Access Database and SDoH-EHR Linkage Tool","abstract":"Background: Social determinants of health (SDoH) play a crucial role in influencing health outcomes, accounting for nearly 50% of modifiable health factors and bringing to light critical disparities among disadvantaged groups. Despite the significant impact of SDoH, existing data resources often fall short in terms of comprehensiveness, integration, and usability.

{"title":"Surviving the frailty of time to event analysis in massive datasets with Generalized Additive Models (and the help of Simon Laplace)","abstract":"Analyses of time to event datasets have been invariably based on the Cox proportional hazards model (PHM). Reformulations of the PHM as a Poisson Generalized Additive Model (GAM) or as a Generalized Linear Mixed Model (GLMM) have been proposed in the literature, aiming to increase the flexibility of the PHM and allow its use in situations in which complex spatiotemporal relationships have to be taken into account when modeling survival. In this report, we provide a unified framework for considering these previous attempts and consider the implementation in software for GAM and GLMM in the R programming language. The connection between GAM\/GLMM and the PHM is leveraged to provide computationally efficient implementations for a subclass of survival models that incorporate individual random effects ('frailty models'). Frailty models provide a unified method to address repeated events, correlated outcomes and also time varying visitation schedules when analyzing Electronic Health Record data. However the current implementation of frailty models in software facilities for the Cox model does not scale because of long computation times; conversely the direct implementation of individual random effects in GAM\/GLMM software does not scale well with memory usage. We propose a two stage method for survival models with frailty based on the Laplace approximation. Using a D-optimal experimental design to simulate the performance of the proposed method across simulated datasets we illustrate that the proposed method can circumvent the limitations of existing implementations, opening up the possibility to model datasets of hundred of thousands to million individuals using high end workstations from within R."}
{"title":"Open-Source Tool for Evaluating Human-Generated vs. AI-Generated Medical Notes Using the PDQI-9 Framework","abstract":"Background: The increasing use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare documentation necessitates robust methods for evaluating the quality of AI-generated medical notes compared to those written by humans. This paper introduces an open-source tool, the Human Notes Evaluator, designed to assess clinical note quality and differentiate between human and AI authorship.

{"title":"Detecting Dataset Bias in Medical AI: A Generalized and Modality-Agnostic Auditing Framework","abstract":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now firmly at the center of evidence-based medicine. Despite many success stories that edge the path of AI's rise in healthcare, there are comparably many reports of significant shortcomings and unexpected behavior of AI in deployment. A major reason for these limitations is AI's reliance on association-based learning, where non-representative machine learning datasets can amplify latent bias during training and\/or hide it during testing. To unlock new tools capable of foreseeing and preventing such AI bias issues, we present G-AUDIT. Generalized Attribute Utility and Detectability-Induced bias Testing (G-AUDIT) for datasets is a modality-agnostic dataset auditing framework that allows for generating targeted hypotheses about sources of bias in training or testing data. Our method examines the relationship between task-level annotations (commonly referred to as ``labels'') and data properties including patient attributes (e.g., age, sex) and environment\/acquisition characteristics (e.g., clinical site, imaging protocols). G-AUDIT quantifies the extent to which the observed data attributes pose a risk for shortcut learning, or in the case of testing data, might hide predictions made based on spurious associations. We demonstrate the broad applicability of our method by analyzing large-scale medical datasets for three distinct modalities and machine learning tasks: skin lesion classification in images, stigmatizing language classification in Electronic Health Records (EHR), and mortality prediction for ICU tabular data. In each setting, G-AUDIT successfully identifies subtle biases commonly overlooked by traditional qualitative methods, underscoring its practical value in exposing dataset-level risks and supporting the downstream development of reliable AI systems."}
{"title":"Developing and Evaluating an AI-Assisted Prediction Model for Unplanned Intensive Care Admissions following Elective Neurosurgery using Natural Language Processing within an Electronic Healthcare Record System","abstract":"Introduction: Timely care in a specialised neuro-intensive therapy unit (ITU) reduces mortality and hospital stays, with planned admissions being safer than unplanned ones. However, post-operative care decisions remain subjective. This study used artificial intelligence (AI), specifically natural language processing (NLP) to analyse electronic health records (EHRs) and predict ITU admissions for elective surgery patients. Methods: This study analysed the EHRs of elective neurosurgery patients from University College London Hospital (UCLH) using NLP. Patients were categorised into planned high dependency unit (HDU) or ITU admission; unplanned HDU or ITU admission; or ward \/ overnight recovery (ONR). The Medical Concept Annotation Tool (MedCAT) was used to identify SNOMED-CT concepts within the clinical notes. We then explored the utility of these identified concepts for a range of AI algorithms trained to predict ITU admission. Results: The CogStack-MedCAT NLP model, initially trained on hospital-wide EHRs, underwent two refinements: first with data from patients with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) and then with data from Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) patients, achieving a concept detection F1-score of 0.93. This refined model was then used to extract concepts from EHR notes of 2,268 eligible neurosurgical patients. We integrated the extracted concepts into AI models, including a decision tree model and a neural time-series model. Using the simpler decision tree model, we achieved a recall of 0.87 (CI 0.82 - 0.91) for ITU admissions, reducing the proportion of unplanned ITU cases missed by human experts from 36% to 4%. Conclusion: The NLP model, refined for accuracy, has proven its efficiency in extracting relevant concepts, providing a reliable basis for predictive AI models to use in clinically valid applications."}
{"title":"Multimodal AI-driven Biomarker for Early Detection of Cancer Cachexia","abstract":"Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive muscle wasting, metabolic dysfunction, and systemic inflammation, leading to reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Despite extensive research, no single definitive biomarker exists, as cachexia-related indicators such as serum biomarkers, skeletal muscle measurements, and metabolic abnormalities often overlap with other conditions. Existing composite indices, including the Cancer Cachexia Index (CXI), Modified CXI (mCXI), and Cachexia Score (CASCO), integrate multiple biomarkers but lack standardized thresholds, limiting their clinical utility. This study proposes a multimodal AI-based biomarker for early cancer cachexia detection, leveraging open-source large language models (LLMs) and foundation models trained on medical data. The approach integrates heterogeneous patient data, including demographics, disease status, lab reports, radiological imaging (CT scans), and clinical notes, using a machine learning framework that can handle missing data. Unlike previous AI-based models trained on curated datasets, this method utilizes routinely collected clinical data, enhancing real-world applicability. Additionally, the model incorporates confidence estimation, allowing the identification of cases requiring expert review for precise clinical interpretation. Preliminary findings demonstrate that integrating multiple data modalities improves cachexia prediction accuracy at the time of cancer diagnosis. The AI-based biomarker dynamically adapts to patient-specific factors such as age, race, ethnicity, weight, cancer type, and stage, avoiding the limitations of fixed-threshold biomarkers. This multimodal AI biomarker provides a scalable and clinically viable solution for early cancer cachexia detection, facilitating personalized interventions and potentially improving treatment outcomes and patient survival."}

{"title":"Adaptive multi-wave sampling for efficient chart validation","abstract":"Computable phenotypes are used to characterize patients and identify outcomes in studies conducted using healthcare claims and electronic health record data. Chart review studies establish reference labels against which computable phenotypes are compared to understand their measurement characteristics, the quantity of interest, for instance the positive predictive value. We describe a method to adaptively evaluate a quantity of interest over sequential samples of charts, with the goal to minimize the number of charts reviewed. With the help of a simultaneous confidence band, we stop the reviewing once the confidence band meets a pre-specified stopping threshold. The contribution of this article is threefold. First, we tested the use of an adaptive approach called Neyman's sampling of charts versus random or stratified random sampling. Second, we propose frequentist confidence bands and Bayesian credible intervals to sequentially evaluate the quantity of interest. Third, we propose a tool to predict the stopping time (defined as the number of charts reviewed) at which the chart review would be complete. We observe that Bayesian credible intervals proved to be tighter than its frequentist confidence band counterparts. Moreover, we observe that simple random sampling is often performing similarly to Neyman's sampling."}
{"title":"Attention-Based Synthetic Data Generation for Calibration-Enhanced Survival Analysis: A Case Study for Chronic Kidney Disease Using Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Access to real-world healthcare data is limited by stringent privacy regulations and data imbalances, hindering advancements in research and clinical applications. Synthetic data presents a promising solution, yet existing methods often fail to ensure the realism, utility, and calibration essential for robust survival analysis. Here, we introduce Masked Clinical Modelling (MCM), an attention-based framework capable of generating high-fidelity synthetic datasets that preserve critical clinical insights, such as hazard ratios, while enhancing survival model calibration. Unlike traditional statistical methods like SMOTE and machine learning models such as VAEs, MCM supports both standalone dataset synthesis for reproducibility and conditional simulation for targeted augmentation, addressing diverse research needs. Validated on a chronic kidney disease electronic health records dataset, MCM reduced the general calibration loss over the entire dataset by 15%; and MCM reduced a mean calibration loss by 9% across 10 clinically stratified subgroups, outperforming 15 alternative methods. By bridging data accessibility with translational utility, MCM advances the precision of healthcare models, promoting more efficient use of scarce healthcare resources."}
{"title":"Zero-shot Medical Event Prediction Using a Generative Pre-trained Transformer on Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Longitudinal data in electronic health records (EHRs) represent an individual`s clinical history through a sequence of codified concepts, including diagnoses, procedures, medications, and laboratory tests. Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) can leverage this data to predict future events. While fine-tuning of these models can enhance task-specific performance, it becomes costly when applied to many clinical prediction tasks. In contrast, a pretrained foundation model can be used in zero-shot forecasting setting, offering a scalable alternative to fine-tuning separate models for each outcome.\n  This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of zero-shot forecasting with GPT-based foundational models in EHRs, introducing a novel pipeline that formulates medical concept prediction as a generative modeling task. Unlike supervised approaches requiring extensive labeled data, our method enables the model to forecast a next medical event purely from a pretraining knowledge. We evaluate performance across multiple time horizons and clinical categories, demonstrating model`s ability to capture latent temporal dependencies and complex patient trajectories without task supervision.\n  Model performance for predicting the next medical concept was evaluated using precision and recall metrics, achieving an average top1 precision of 0.614 and recall of 0.524. For 12 major diagnostic conditions, the model demonstrated strong zero-shot performance, achieving high true positive rates while maintaining low false positives.\n  We demonstrate the power of a foundational EHR GPT model in capturing diverse phenotypes and enabling robust, zero-shot forecasting of clinical outcomes. This capability enhances the versatility of predictive healthcare models and reduces the need for task-specific training, enabling more scalable applications in clinical settings."}
{"title":"TIMER: Temporal Instruction Modeling and Evaluation for Longitudinal Clinical Records","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for assisting in medical tasks, yet processing Electronic Health Records (EHRs) presents unique challenges due to their longitudinal nature.

{"title":"Benchmarking Large Language Models on Multiple Tasks in Bioinformatics NLP with Prompting","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have become important tools in solving biological problems, offering improvements in accuracy and adaptability over conventional methods. Several benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of these LLMs. However, current benchmarks can hardly evaluate the performance of these models across diverse tasks effectively. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive prompting-based benchmarking framework, termed Bio-benchmark, which includes 30 key bioinformatics tasks covering areas such as proteins, RNA, drugs, electronic health records, and traditional Chinese medicine. Using this benchmark, we evaluate six mainstream LLMs, including GPT-4o and Llama-3.1-70b, etc., using 0-shot and few-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) settings without fine-tuning to reveal their intrinsic capabilities. To improve the efficiency of our evaluations, we demonstrate BioFinder, a new tool for extracting answers from LLM responses, which increases extraction accuracy by round 30% compared to existing methods. Our benchmark results show the biological tasks suitable for current LLMs and identify specific areas requiring enhancement. Furthermore, we propose targeted prompt engineering strategies for optimizing LLM performance in these contexts. Based on these findings, we provide recommendations for the development of more robust LLMs tailored for various biological applications. This work offers a comprehensive evaluation framework and robust tools to support the application of LLMs in bioinformatics."}
{"title":"Deep Causal Behavioral Policy Learning: Applications to Healthcare","abstract":"We present a deep learning-based approach to studying dynamic clinical behavioral regimes in diverse non-randomized healthcare settings. Our proposed methodology - deep causal behavioral policy learning (DC-BPL) - uses deep learning algorithms to learn the distribution of high-dimensional clinical action paths, and identifies the causal link between these action paths and patient outcomes. Specifically, our approach: (1) identifies the causal effects of provider assignment on clinical outcomes; (2) learns the distribution of clinical actions a given provider would take given evolving patient information; (3) and combines these steps to identify the optimal provider for a given patient type and emulate that provider's care decisions. Underlying this strategy, we train a large clinical behavioral model (LCBM) on electronic health records data using a transformer architecture, and demonstrate its ability to estimate clinical behavioral policies. We propose a novel interpretation of a behavioral policy learned using the LCBM: that it is an efficient encoding of complex, often implicit, knowledge used to treat a patient. This allows us to learn a space of policies that are critical to a wide range of healthcare applications, in which the vast majority of clinical knowledge is acquired tacitly through years of practice and only a tiny fraction of information relevant to patient care is written down (e.g. in textbooks, studies or standardized guidelines)."}
{"title":"Fine-grained Alignment of Large Language Models for General Medication Recommendation without Overprescription","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) holds significant promise in achieving general medication recommendation systems owing to their comprehensive interpretation of clinical notes and flexibility to medication encoding.

{"title":"Leveraging Taxonomy Similarity for Next Activity Prediction in Patient Treatment","abstract":"The rapid progress in modern medicine presents physicians with complex challenges when planning patient treatment. Techniques from the field of Predictive Business Process Monitoring, like Next-activity-prediction (NAP) can be used as a promising technique to support physicians in treatment planning, by proposing a possible next treatment step. Existing patient data, often in the form of electronic health records, can be analyzed to recommend the next suitable step in the treatment process. However, the use of patient data poses many challenges due to its knowledge-intensive character, high variability and scarcity of medical data. To overcome these challenges, this article examines the use of the knowledge encoded in taxonomies to improve and explain the prediction of the next activity in the treatment process. This study proposes the TS4NAP approach, which uses medical taxonomies (ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS) in combination with graph matching to assess the similarities of medical codes to predict the next treatment step. The effectiveness of the proposed approach will be evaluated using event logs that are derived from the MIMIC-IV dataset. The results highlight the potential of using domain-specific knowledge held in taxonomies to improve the prediction of the next activity, and thus can improve treatment planning and decision-making by making the predictions more explainable."}
{"title":"Fast and robust invariant generalized linear models","abstract":"Statistical integration of diverse data sources is an essential step in the building of generalizable prediction tools, especially in precision health. The invariant features model is a new paradigm for multi-source data integration which posits that a small number of covariates affect the outcome identically across all possible environments. Existing methods for estimating invariant effects suffer from immense computational costs or only offer good statistical performance under strict assumptions. In this work, we provide a general framework for estimation under the invariant features model that is computationally efficient and statistically flexible. We also provide a robust extension of our proposed method to protect against possibly corrupted or misspecified data sources. We demonstrate the robust properties of our method via simulations, and use it to build a transferable prediction model for end stage renal disease using electronic health records from the All of Us research program."}
{"title":"Integrating Misclassified EHR Outcomes with Validated Outcomes from a Non-probability Sample","abstract":"Although increasingly used for research, electronic health records (EHR) often lack gold-standard assessment of key data elements. Linking EHRs to other data sources with higher-quality measurements can improve statistical inference, but such analyses must account for selection bias if the linked data source arises from a non-probability sample. We propose a set of novel estimators targeting the average treatment effect (ATE) that combine information from binary outcomes measured with error in a large, population-representative EHR database with gold-standard outcomes obtained from a smaller validation sample subject to selection bias. We evaluate our approach in extensive simulations and an analysis of data from the Adult Changes in Thought (ACT) study, a longitudinal study of incident dementia in a cohort of Kaiser Permanente Washington members with linked EHR data. For a subset of deceased ACT participants who consented to brain autopsy prior to death, gold-standard measures of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology are available. Our proposed estimators reduced bias and improved efficiency for the ATE, facilitating valid inference with EHR data when key data elements are ascertained with error."}
{"title":"EPEE: Towards Efficient and Effective Foundation Models in Biomedicine","abstract":"Foundation models, including language models, e.g., GPT, and vision models, e.g., CLIP, have significantly advanced numerous biomedical tasks. Despite these advancements, the high inference latency and the \"overthinking\" issues in model inference impair the efficiency and effectiveness of foundation models, thus limiting their application in real-time clinical settings. To address these challenges, we proposed EPEE (Entropy- and Patience-based Early Exiting), a novel hybrid strategy designed to improve the inference efficiency of foundation models. The core idea was to leverage the strengths of entropy-based and patience-based early exiting methods to overcome their respective weaknesses. To evaluate EPEE, we conducted experiments on three core biomedical tasks-classification, relation extraction, and event extraction-using four foundation models (BERT, ALBERT, GPT-2, and ViT) across twelve datasets, including clinical notes and medical images. The results showed that EPEE significantly reduced inference time while maintaining or improving accuracy, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse datasets and tasks. EPEE addressed critical barriers to deploying foundation models in healthcare by balancing efficiency and effectiveness. It potentially provided a practical solution for real-time clinical decision-making with foundation models, supporting reliable and efficient workflows."}
{"title":"Large Language Models for Healthcare Text Classification: A Systematic Review","abstract":"Large Language Models (LLMs) have fundamentally transformed approaches to Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks across diverse domains. In healthcare, accurate and cost-efficient text classification is crucial, whether for clinical notes analysis, diagnosis coding, or any other task, and LLMs present promising potential. Text classification has always faced multiple challenges, including manual annotation for training, handling imbalanced data, and developing scalable approaches. With healthcare, additional challenges are added, particularly the critical need to preserve patients' data privacy and the complexity of the medical terminology. Numerous studies have been conducted to leverage LLMs for automated healthcare text classification and contrast the results with existing machine learning-based methods where embedding, annotation, and training are traditionally required. Existing systematic reviews about LLMs either do not specialize in text classification or do not focus on the healthcare domain. This research synthesizes and critically evaluates the current evidence found in the literature regarding the use of LLMs for text classification in a healthcare setting. Major databases (e.g., Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, Science Direct) and other resources were queried, which focused on the papers published between 2018 and 2024 within the framework of PRISMA guidelines, which resulted in 65 eligible research articles. These were categorized by text classification type (e.g., binary classification, multi-label classification), application (e.g., clinical decision support, public health and opinion analysis), methodology, type of healthcare text, and metrics used for evaluation and validation. This review reveals the existing gaps in the literature and suggests future research lines that can be investigated and explored."}
{"title":"Systematic Literature Review on Clinical Trial Eligibility Matching","abstract":"Clinical trial eligibility matching is a critical yet often labor-intensive and error-prone step in medical research, as it ensures that participants meet precise criteria for safe and reliable study outcomes. Recent advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have shown promise in automating and improving this process by rapidly analyzing large volumes of unstructured clinical text and structured electronic health record (EHR) data. In this paper, we present a systematic overview of current NLP methodologies applied to clinical trial eligibility screening, focusing on data sources, annotation practices, machine learning approaches, and real-world implementation challenges. A comprehensive literature search (spanning Google Scholar, Mendeley, and PubMed from 2015 to 2024) yielded high-quality studies, each demonstrating the potential of techniques such as rule-based systems, named entity recognition, contextual embeddings, and ontology-based normalization to enhance patient matching accuracy. While results indicate substantial improvements in screening efficiency and precision, limitations persist regarding data completeness, annotation consistency, and model scalability across diverse clinical domains.

We present a new dataset for ICD coding, which includes diagnosis fields from electronic health records (EHRs) annotated with over 10,000 entities and more than 1,500 unique ICD codes. This dataset serves as a benchmark for several state-of-the-art models, including BERT, LLaMA with LoRA, and RAG, with additional experiments examining transfer learning across domains (from PubMed abstracts to medical diagnosis) and terminologies (from UMLS concepts to ICD codes). We then apply the best-performing model to label an in-house EHR dataset containing patient histories from 2017 to 2021. Our experiments, conducted on a carefully curated test set, demonstrate that training with the automated predicted codes leads to a significant improvement in accuracy compared to manually annotated data from physicians.

{"title":"Generating Clinically Realistic EHR Data via a Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer","abstract":"Generating realistic synthetic electronic health records (EHRs) holds tremendous promise for accelerating healthcare research, facilitating AI model development and enhancing patient privacy. However, existing generative methods typically treat EHRs as flat sequences of discrete medical codes. This approach overlooks two critical aspects: the inherent hierarchical organization of clinical coding systems and the rich semantic context provided by code descriptions. Consequently, synthetic patient sequences often lack high clinical fidelity and have limited utility in downstream clinical tasks. In this paper, we propose the Hierarchy- and Semantics-Guided Transformer (HiSGT), a novel framework that leverages both hierarchical and semantic information for the generative process. HiSGT constructs a hierarchical graph to encode parent-child and sibling relationships among clinical codes and employs a graph neural network to derive hierarchy-aware embeddings. These are then fused with semantic embeddings extracted from a pre-trained clinical language model (e.g., ClinicalBERT), enabling the Transformer-based generator to more accurately model the nuanced clinical patterns inherent in real EHRs. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that HiSGT significantly improves the statistical alignment of synthetic data with real patient records, as well as supports robust downstream applications such as chronic disease classification. By addressing the limitations of conventional raw code-based generative models, HiSGT represents a significant step toward clinically high-fidelity synthetic data generation and a general paradigm suitable for interpretable medical code representation, offering valuable applications in data augmentation and privacy-preserving healthcare analytics."}
{"title":"Revealing Treatment Non-Adherence Bias in Clinical Machine Learning Using Large Language Models","abstract":"Machine learning systems trained on electronic health records (EHRs) increasingly guide treatment decisions, but their reliability depends on the critical assumption that patients follow the prescribed treatments recorded in EHRs. Using EHR data from 3,623 hypertension patients, we investigate how treatment non-adherence introduces implicit bias that can fundamentally distort both causal inference and predictive modeling. By extracting patient adherence information from clinical notes using a large language model (LLM), we identify 786 patients (21.7%) with medication non-adherence. We further uncover key demographic and clinical factors associated with non-adherence, as well as patient-reported reasons including side effects and difficulties obtaining refills. Our findings demonstrate that this implicit bias can not only reverse estimated treatment effects, but also degrade model performance by up to 5% while disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations by exacerbating disparities in decision outcomes and model error rates. This highlights the importance of accounting for treatment non-adherence in developing responsible and equitable clinical machine learning systems."}
{"title":"Patient Trajectory Prediction: Integrating Clinical Notes with Transformers","abstract":"Predicting disease trajectories from electronic health records (EHRs) is a complex task due to major challenges such as data non-stationarity, high granularity of medical codes, and integration of multimodal data. EHRs contain both structured data, such as diagnostic codes, and unstructured data, such as clinical notes, which hold essential information often overlooked. Current models, primarily based on structured data, struggle to capture the complete medical context of patients, resulting in a loss of valuable information. To address this issue, we propose an approach that integrates unstructured clinical notes into transformer-based deep learning models for sequential disease prediction. This integration enriches the representation of patients' medical histories, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnosis predictions. Experiments on MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional models relying solely on structured data."}
{"title":"Enhancing Hepatopathy Clinical Trial Efficiency: A Secure, Large Language Model-Powered Pre-Screening Pipeline","abstract":"Background: Recruitment for cohorts involving complex liver diseases, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and liver cirrhosis, often requires interpreting semantically complex criteria. Traditional manual screening methods are time-consuming and prone to errors. While AI-powered pre-screening offers potential solutions, challenges remain regarding accuracy, efficiency, and data privacy. Methods: We developed a novel patient pre-screening pipeline that leverages clinical expertise to guide the precise, safe, and efficient application of large language models. The pipeline breaks down complex criteria into a series of composite questions and then employs two strategies to perform semantic question-answering through electronic health records - (1) Pathway A, Anthropomorphized Experts' Chain of Thought strategy, and (2) Pathway B, Preset Stances within an Agent Collaboration strategy, particularly in managing complex clinical reasoning scenarios. The pipeline is evaluated on three key metrics-precision, time consumption, and counterfactual inference - at both the question and criterion levels. Results: Our pipeline achieved high precision (0.921, in criteria level) and efficiency (0.44s per task). Pathway B excelled in complex reasoning, while Pathway A was effective in precise data extraction with faster processing times. Both pathways achieved comparable precision. The pipeline showed promising results in hepatocellular carcinoma (0.878) and cirrhosis trials (0.843). Conclusions: This data-secure and time-efficient pipeline shows high precision in hepatopathy trials, providing promising solutions for streamlining clinical trial workflows. Its efficiency and adaptability make it suitable for improving patient recruitment. And its capability to function in resource-constrained environments further enhances its utility in clinical settings."}

{"title":"Large Language Models are Powerful Electronic Health Record Encoders","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer considerable potential for clinical prediction, but their complexity and heterogeneity present significant challenges for traditional machine learning methods. Recently, domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large volumes of unlabeled EHR data have shown improved predictive accuracy and generalization. However, their development is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets, and inconsistencies in coding standards and clinical practices. In this study, we explore the use of general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to encode EHR into high-dimensional representations for downstream clinical prediction tasks. We convert structured EHR data into Markdown-formatted plain-text documents by replacing medical codes with natural language descriptions. This enables the use of LLMs and their extensive semantic understanding and generalization capabilities as effective encoders of EHRs without requiring access to private medical training data. We show that LLM-based embeddings can often match or even surpass the performance of a specialized EHR foundation model, CLMBR-T-Base, across 15 diverse clinical tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark. Critically, our approach requires no institution-specific training and can incorporate any medical code with a text description, whereas existing EHR foundation models operate on fixed vocabularies and can only process codes seen during pretraining. To demonstrate generalizability, we further evaluate the approach on the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort, out-of-domain for CLMBR-T-Base, whose fixed vocabulary covers only 16% of UKB codes. Notably, an LLM-based model achieves superior performance for prediction of disease onset, hospitalization, and mortality, indicating robustness to population and coding shifts."}
{"title":"Design and Implementation of a Scalable Clinical Data Warehouse for Resource-Constrained Healthcare Systems","abstract":"Centralized electronic health record repositories are critical for advancing disease surveillance, public health research, and evidence-based policymaking. However, developing countries face persistent challenges in achieving this due to fragmented healthcare data sources, inconsistent record-keeping practices, and the absence of standardized patient identifiers, limiting reliable record linkage, compromise data interoperability, and limit scalability-obstacles exacerbated by infrastructural constraints and privacy concerns. To address these barriers, this study proposes a scalable, privacy-preserving clinical data warehouse, NCDW, designed for heterogeneous EHR integration in resource-limited settings and tested with 1.16 million clinical records. The framework incorporates a wrapper-based data acquisition layer for secure, automated ingestion of multisource health data and introduces a soundex algorithm to resolve patient identity mismatches in the absence of unique IDs. A modular data mart is designed for disease-specific analytics, demonstrated through a dengue fever case study in Bangladesh, integrating clinical, demographic, and environmental data for outbreak prediction and resource planning. Quantitative assessment of the data mart underscores its utility in strengthening national decision-support systems, highlighting the model's adaptability for infectious disease management. Comparative evaluation of database technologies reveals NoSQL outperforms relational SQL by 40-69% in complex query processing, while system load estimates validate the architecture's capacity to manage 19 million daily records (34TB over 5 years). The framework can be adapted to various healthcare settings across developing nations by modifying the ingestion layer to accommodate standards like ICD-11 and HL7 FHIR, facilitating interoperability for managing infectious diseases (i.e., COVID, tuberculosis)."}
{"title":"Enhancing LLMs for Identifying and Prioritizing Important Medical Jargons from Electronic Health Record Notes Utilizing Data Augmentation","abstract":"OpenNotes enables patients to access EHR notes, but medical jargon can hinder comprehension. To improve understanding, we evaluated closed- and open-source LLMs for extracting and prioritizing key medical terms using prompting, fine-tuning, and data augmentation. We assessed LLMs on 106 expert-annotated EHR notes, experimenting with (i) general vs. structured prompts, (ii) zero-shot vs. few-shot prompting, (iii) fine-tuning, and (iv) data augmentation. To enhance open-source models in low-resource settings, we used ChatGPT for data augmentation and applied ranking techniques. We incrementally increased the augmented dataset size (10 to 10,000) and conducted 5-fold cross-validation, reporting F1 score and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). Our result show that fine-tuning and data augmentation improved performance over other strategies. GPT-4 Turbo achieved the highest F1 (0.433), while Mistral7B with data augmentation had the highest MRR (0.746). Open-source models, when fine-tuned or augmented, outperformed closed-source models. Notably, the best F1 and MRR scores did not always align. Few-shot prompting outperformed zero-shot in vanilla models, and structured prompts yielded different preferences across models. Fine-tuning improved zero-shot performance but sometimes degraded few-shot performance. Data augmentation performed comparably or better than other methods. Our evaluation highlights the effectiveness of prompting, fine-tuning, and data augmentation in improving model performance for medical jargon extraction in low-resource scenarios."}
{"title":"LabTOP: A Unified Model for Lab Test Outcome Prediction on Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Lab tests are fundamental for diagnosing diseases and monitoring patient conditions. However, frequent testing can be burdensome for patients, and test results may not always be immediately available. To address these challenges, we propose LabTOP, a unified model that predicts lab test outcomes by leveraging a language modeling approach on EHR data. Unlike conventional methods that estimate only a subset of lab tests or classify discrete value ranges, LabTOP performs continuous numerical predictions for a diverse range of lab items. We evaluate LabTOP on three publicly available EHR datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods, including traditional machine learning models and state-of-the-art large language models. We also conduct extensive ablation studies to confirm the effectiveness of our design choices. We believe that LabTOP will serve as an accurate and generalizable framework for lab test outcome prediction, with potential applications in clinical decision support and early detection of critical conditions."}
{"title":"Democratizing Large Language Model-Based Graph Data Augmentation via Latent Knowledge Graphs","abstract":"Data augmentation is necessary for graph representation learning due to the scarcity and noise present in graph data. Most of the existing augmentation methods overlook the context information inherited from the dataset as they rely solely on the graph structure for augmentation. Despite the success of some large language model-based (LLM) graph learning methods, they are mostly white-box which require access to the weights or latent features from the open-access LLMs, making them difficult to be democratized for everyone as existing LLMs are mostly closed-source for commercial considerations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a black-box context-driven graph data augmentation approach, with the guidance of LLMs -- DemoGraph. Leveraging the text prompt as context-related information, we task the LLM with generating knowledge graphs (KGs), which allow us to capture the structural interactions from the text outputs. We then design a dynamic merging schema to stochastically integrate the LLM-generated KGs into the original graph during training. To control the sparsity of the augmented graph, we further devise a granularity-aware prompting strategy and an instruction fine-tuning module, which seamlessly generates text prompts according to different granularity levels of the dataset. Extensive experiments on various graph learning tasks validate the effectiveness of our method over existing graph data augmentation methods. Notably, our approach excels in scenarios involving electronic health records (EHRs), which validates its maximal utilization of contextual knowledge, leading to enhanced predictive performance and interpretability."}
{"title":"ProMedTS: A Self-Supervised, Prompt-Guided Multimodal Approach for Integrating Medical Text and Time Series","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in vision-language tasks, but their application in the medical field remains underexplored, particularly for integrating structured time series data with unstructured clinical notes. In clinical practice, dynamic time series data, such as lab test results, capture critical temporal patterns, while clinical notes provide rich semantic context. Merging these modalities is challenging due to the inherent differences between continuous signals and discrete text. To bridge this gap, we introduce ProMedTS, a novel self-supervised multimodal framework that employs prompt-guided learning to unify these heterogeneous data types. Our approach leverages lightweight anomaly detection to generate anomaly captions that serve as prompts, guiding the encoding of raw time series data into informative prompt embeddings. These prompt embeddings are aligned with textual representations in a shared latent space, preserving fine-grained temporal nuances alongside semantic insights. Furthermore, our framework incorporates tailored self-supervised objectives to enhance both intra- and inter-modal alignment. We evaluate ProMedTS on disease diagnosis tasks using real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches."}
{"title":"RGAR: Recurrence Generation-augmented Retrieval for Factual-aware Medical Question Answering","abstract":"Medical question answering requires extensive access to specialized conceptual knowledge. The current paradigm, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), acquires expertise medical knowledge through large-scale corpus retrieval and uses this knowledge to guide a general-purpose large language model (LLM) for generating answers. However, existing retrieval approaches often overlook the importance of factual knowledge, which limits the relevance of retrieved conceptual knowledge and restricts its applicability in real-world scenarios, such as clinical decision-making based on Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This paper introduces RGAR, a recurrence generation-augmented retrieval framework that retrieves both relevant factual and conceptual knowledge from dual sources (i.e., EHRs and the corpus), allowing them to interact and refine each another. Through extensive evaluation across three factual-aware medical question answering benchmarks, RGAR establishes a new state-of-the-art performance among medical RAG systems. Notably, the Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct model with RGAR surpasses the considerably larger, RAG-enhanced GPT-3.5.

We show that these merge moves require only summaries of the data in each batch, enabling federated learning across local nodes without requiring the full dataset to be shared. Empirical results on simulated and benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method performs well in comparison to existing clustering algorithms. We validate the practical utility of the method by applying it to large scale electronic health record (EHR) data."}
{"title":"A Novel Chaos-Based Cryptographic Scrambling Technique to Secure Medical Images","abstract":"These days, a tremendous quantity of digital visual data is sent over many networks and stored in many different formats. This visual information is usually very confidential and financially rewarding. Maintaining safe transmission of data is crucial, as is the use of approaches to offer security features like privacy, integrity, or authentication that are tailored to certain types of data. Protecting sensitive medical images stored in electronic health records is the focus of this article, which proposes a technique of encryption and decryption. In order to safe-guard image-based programs, encryption methods are applied. Privacy, integrity, and authenticity are only few of the security elements investigated by the proposed system, which encrypts medical pictures using chaos maps. In all stages of the protocol, the suggested chaos-based data scrambling method is employed to mitigate the short-comings of traditional confusion and diffusion designs. Bifurcation charts, Lyapunov exponents, tests for mean squared error and peak-to-average signal-to-noise ratio, and histogram analysis are only some of the tools we use to investigate the suggested system's chaotic behavior."}
{"title":"Self-Explaining Hypergraph Neural Networks for Diagnosis Prediction","abstract":"The burgeoning volume of electronic health records (EHRs) has enabled deep learning models to excel in predictive healthcare. However, for high-stakes applications such as diagnosis prediction, model interpretability remains paramount. Existing deep learning diagnosis prediction models with intrinsic interpretability often assign attention weights to every past diagnosis or hospital visit, providing explanations lacking flexibility and succinctness. In this paper, we introduce SHy, a self-explaining hypergraph neural network model, designed to offer personalized, concise and faithful explanations that allow for interventions from clinical experts. By modeling each patient as a unique hypergraph and employing a message-passing mechanism, SHy captures higher-order disease interactions and extracts distinct temporal phenotypes as personalized explanations. It also addresses the incompleteness of the EHR data by accounting for essential false negatives in the original diagnosis record. A qualitative case study and extensive quantitative evaluations on two real-world EHR datasets demonstrate the superior predictive performance and interpretability of SHy over existing state-of-the-art models."}

{"title":"Evaluating GPT's Capability in Identifying Stages of Cognitive Impairment from Electronic Health Data","abstract":"Identifying cognitive impairment within electronic health records (EHRs) is crucial not only for timely diagnoses but also for facilitating research. Information about cognitive impairment often exists within unstructured clinician notes in EHRs, but manual chart reviews are both time-consuming and error-prone. To address this issue, our study evaluates an automated approach using zero-shot GPT-4o to determine stage of cognitive impairment in two different tasks. First, we evaluated the ability of GPT-4o to determine the global Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) on specialist notes from 769 patients who visited the memory clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), and achieved a weighted kappa score of 0.83. Second, we assessed GPT-4o's ability to differentiate between normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and dementia on all notes in a 3-year window from 860 Medicare patients. GPT-4o attained a weighted kappa score of 0.91 in comparison to specialist chart reviews and 0.96 on cases that the clinical adjudicators rated with high confidence. Our findings demonstrate GPT-4o's potential as a scalable chart review tool for creating research datasets and assisting diagnosis in clinical settings in the future."}
{"title":"Representation Learning to Advance Multi-institutional Studies with Electronic Health Record Data","abstract":"The adoption of EHRs has expanded opportunities to leverage data-driven algorithms in clinical care and research. A major bottleneck in effectively conducting multi-institutional EHR studies is the data heterogeneity across systems with numerous codes that either do not exist or represent different clinical concepts across institutions. The need for data privacy further limits the feasibility of including multi-institutional patient-level data required to study similarities and differences across patient subgroups. To address these challenges, we developed the GAME algorithm. Tested and validated across 7 institutions and 2 languages, GAME integrates data in several levels: (1) at the institutional level with knowledge graphs to establish relationships between codes and existing knowledge sources, providing the medical context for standard codes and their relationship to each other; (2) between institutions, leveraging language models to determine the relationships between institution-specific codes with established standard codes; and (3) quantifying the strength of the relationships between codes using a graph attention network. Jointly trained embeddings are created using transfer and federated learning to preserve data privacy. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of GAME in selecting relevant features as inputs for AI-driven algorithms in a range of conditions, e.g., heart failure, rheumatoid arthritis. We then highlight the application of GAME harmonized multi-institutional EHR data in a study of Alzheimer's disease outcomes and suicide risk among patients with mental health disorders, without sharing patient-level data outside individual institutions."}

{"title":"CliniQ: A Multi-faceted Benchmark for Electronic Health Record Retrieval with Semantic Match Assessment","abstract":"Electronic Health Record (EHR) retrieval plays a pivotal role in various clinical tasks, but its development has been severely impeded by the lack of publicly available benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a novel public EHR retrieval benchmark, CliniQ, to address this gap. We consider two retrieval settings: Single-Patient Retrieval and Multi-Patient Retrieval, reflecting various real-world scenarios. Single-Patient Retrieval focuses on finding relevant parts within a patient note, while Multi-Patient Retrieval involves retrieving EHRs from multiple patients. We build our benchmark upon 1,000 discharge summary notes along with the ICD codes and prescription labels from MIMIC-III, and collect 1,246 unique queries with 77,206 relevance judgments by further leveraging powerful LLMs as annotators. Additionally, we include a novel assessment of the semantic gap issue in EHR retrieval by categorizing matching types into string match and four types of semantic matches. On our proposed benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various retrieval methods, ranging from conventional exact match to popular dense retrievers. Our experiments find that BM25 sets a strong baseline and performs competitively to the dense retrievers, and general domain dense retrievers surprisingly outperform those designed for the medical domain. In-depth analyses on various matching types reveal the strengths and drawbacks of different methods, enlightening the potential for targeted improvement. We believe that our benchmark will stimulate the research communities to advance EHR retrieval systems."}
{"title":"Can ChatGPT Diagnose Alzheimer's Disease?","abstract":"Can ChatGPT diagnose Alzheimer's Disease (AD)? AD is a devastating neurodegenerative condition that affects approximately 1 in 9 individuals aged 65 and older, profoundly impairing memory and cognitive function. This paper utilises 9300 electronic health records (EHRs) with data from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and cognitive tests to address an intriguing question: As a general-purpose task solver, can ChatGPT accurately detect AD using EHRs? We present an in-depth evaluation of ChatGPT using a black-box approach with zero-shot and multi-shot methods. This study unlocks ChatGPT's capability to analyse MRI and cognitive test results, as well as its potential as a diagnostic tool for AD. By automating aspects of the diagnostic process, this research opens a transformative approach for the healthcare system, particularly in addressing disparities in resource-limited regions where AD specialists are scarce. Hence, it offers a foundation for a promising method for early detection, supporting individuals with timely interventions, which is paramount for Quality of Life (QoL)."}
{"title":"AI-Driven Electronic Health Records System for Enhancing Patient Data Management and Diagnostic Support in Egypt","abstract":"Digital healthcare infrastructure is crucial for global medical service delivery. Egypt faces EHR adoption barriers: only 314 hospitals had such systems as of Oct 2024. This limits data management and decision-making. This project introduces an EHR system for Egypt's Universal Health Insurance and healthcare ecosystem. It simplifies data management by centralizing medical histories with a scalable micro-services architecture and polyglot persistence for real-time access and provider communication. Clinical workflows are enhanced via patient examination and history tracking. The system uses the Llama3-OpenBioLLM-70B model to generate summaries of medical histories, provide chatbot features, and generate AI-based medical reports, enabling efficient searches during consultations. A Vision Transformer (ViT) aids in pneumonia classification. Evaluations show the AI excels in capturing details (high recall) but needs improvement in concise narratives. With optimization (retrieval-augmented generation, local data fine-tuning, interoperability protocols), this AI-driven EHR could enhance diagnostic support, decision-making, and healthcare delivery in Egypt."}
{"title":"Overcoming data challenges through enriched validation and targeted sampling to measure whole-person health in electronic health records","abstract":"The allostatic load index (ALI) is a 10-component measure of whole-person health. Data from electronic health records (EHR) present a huge opportunity to operationalize the ALI in learning health systems; however, these data are prone to missingness and errors. Validation (e.g., through chart reviews) provides better-quality data, but realistically, only a subset of patients' data can be validated, and most protocols do not recover missing data. Using a representative sample of 1000 patients from the EHR at an extensive learning health system (100 of whom could be validated), we propose methods to design, conduct, and analyze statistically efficient and robust studies of ALI and healthcare utilization. Employing semiparametric maximum likelihood estimation, we robustly incorporate all available patient information into statistical models. Using targeted design strategies, we examine ways to select the most informative patients for validation. Incorporating clinical expertise, we devise a novel validation protocol to promote EHR data quality and completeness. Chart reviews uncovered few errors (99% matched source documents) and recovered some missing data through auxiliary information in patients' charts. On average, validation increased the number of non-missing ALI components per patient from 6 to 7. Through simulations based on preliminary data, residual sampling was identified as the most informative strategy for completing our validation study. Incorporating validation data, statistical models indicated that worse whole-person health (higher ALI) was associated with higher odds of engaging in the healthcare system, adjusting for age."}
{"title":"Large Language Models in Healthcare","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for transforming healthcare, from streamlining administrative and clinical workflows to enriching patient engagement and advancing clinical decision-making. However, their successful integration requires rigorous development, adaptation, and evaluation strategies tailored to clinical needs. In this Review, we highlight recent advancements, explore emerging opportunities for LLM-driven innovation, and propose a framework for their responsible implementation in healthcare settings. We examine strategies for adapting LLMs to domain-specific healthcare tasks, such as fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and multimodal integration with electronic health records. We also summarize various evaluation metrics tailored to healthcare, addressing clinical accuracy, fairness, robustness, and patient outcomes. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges associated with deploying LLMs in healthcare--including data privacy, bias mitigation, regulatory compliance, and computational sustainability--and underscore the need for interdisciplinary collaboration. Finally, these challenges present promising future research directions for advancing LLM implementation in clinical settings and healthcare."}
{"title":"Leveraging Geolocation in Clinical Records to Improve Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Using DMV Framework","abstract":"Alzheimer's Disease (AD) early detection is critical for enabling timely intervention and improving patient outcomes. This paper presents a DMV framework using Llama3-70B and GPT-4o as embedding models to analyze clinical notes and predict a continuous risk score associated with early AD onset. Framing the task as a regression problem, we model the relationship between linguistic features in clinical notes (inputs) and a target variable (data value) that answers specific questions related to AD risk within certain topic categories. By leveraging a multi-faceted feature set that includes geolocation data, we capture additional environmental context potentially linked to AD. Our results demonstrate that the integration of the geolocation information significantly decreases the error of predicting early AD risk scores over prior models by 28.57% (Llama3-70B) and 33.47% (GPT4-o). Our findings suggest that this combined approach can enhance the predictive accuracy of AD risk assessment, supporting early diagnosis and intervention in clinical settings. Additionally, the framework's ability to incorporate geolocation data provides a more comprehensive risk assessment model that could help healthcare providers better understand and address environmental factors contributing to AD development."}
{"title":"MedRAG: Enhancing Retrieval-augmented Generation with Knowledge Graph-Elicited Reasoning for Healthcare Copilot","abstract":"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is a well-suited technique for retrieving privacy-sensitive Electronic Health Records (EHR). It can serve as a key module of the healthcare copilot, helping reduce misdiagnosis for healthcare practitioners and patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy and specificity of existing heuristic-based RAG models used in the medical domain are inadequate, particularly for diseases with similar manifestations. This paper proposes MedRAG, a RAG model enhanced by knowledge graph (KG)-elicited reasoning for the medical domain that retrieves diagnosis and treatment recommendations based on manifestations. MedRAG systematically constructs a comprehensive four-tier hierarchical diagnostic KG encompassing critical diagnostic differences of various diseases. These differences are dynamically integrated with similar EHRs retrieved from an EHR database, and reasoned within a large language model. This process enables more accurate and specific decision support, while also proactively providing follow-up questions to enhance personalized medical decision-making. MedRAG is evaluated on both a public dataset DDXPlus and a private chronic pain diagnostic dataset (CPDD) collected from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and its performance is compared against various existing RAG methods. Experimental results show that, leveraging the information integration and relational abilities of the KG, our MedRAG provides more specific diagnostic insights and outperforms state-of-the-art models in reducing misdiagnosis rates.

{"title":"Multimodal Medical Code Tokenizer","abstract":"Foundation models trained on patient electronic health records (EHRs) require tokenizing medical data into sequences of discrete vocabulary items. Existing tokenizers treat medical codes from EHRs as isolated textual tokens. However, each medical code is defined by its textual description, its position in ontological hierarchies, and its relationships to other codes, such as disease co-occurrences and drug-treatment associations. Medical vocabularies contain more than 600,000 codes with critical information for clinical reasoning. We introduce MedTok, a multimodal medical code tokenizer that uses the text descriptions and relational context of codes. MedTok processes text using a language model encoder and encodes the relational structure with a graph encoder. It then quantizes both modalities into a unified token space, preserving modality-specific and cross-modality information. We integrate MedTok into five EHR models and evaluate it on operational and clinical tasks across in-patient and out-patient datasets, including outcome prediction, diagnosis classification, drug recommendation, and risk stratification. Swapping standard EHR tokenizers with MedTok improves AUPRC across all EHR models, by 4.10% on MIMIC-III, 4.78% on MIMIC-IV, and 11.32% on EHRShot, with the largest gains in drug recommendation. Beyond EHR modeling, we demonstrate using MedTok tokenizer with medical QA systems. Our results demonstrate the potential of MedTok as a unified tokenizer for medical codes, improving tokenization for medical foundation models."}

{"title":"Efficient extraction of medication information from clinical notes: an evaluation in two languages","abstract":"Objective: To evaluate the accuracy, computational cost and portability of a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) method for extracting medication information from clinical narratives. Materials and Methods: We propose an original transformer-based architecture for the extraction of entities and their relations pertaining to patients' medication regimen. First, we used this approach to train and evaluate a model on French clinical notes, using a newly annotated corpus from H\u00f4pitaux Universitaires de Strasbourg. Second, the portability of the approach was assessed by conducting an evaluation on clinical documents in English from the 2018 n2c2 shared task. Information extraction accuracy and computational cost were assessed by comparison with an available method using transformers. Results: The proposed architecture achieves on the task of relation extraction itself performance that are competitive with the state-of-the-art on both French and English (F-measures 0.82 and 0.96 vs 0.81 and 0.95), but reduce the computational cost by 10. End-to-end (Named Entity recognition and Relation Extraction) F1 performance is 0.69 and 0.82 for French and English corpus. Discussion: While an existing system developed for English notes was deployed in a French hospital setting with reasonable effort, we found that an alternative architecture offered end-to-end drug information extraction with comparable extraction performance and lower computational impact for both French and English clinical text processing, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed architecture can be used to extract medication information from clinical text with high performance and low computational cost and consequently suits with usually limited hospital IT resources"}
{"title":"Mining Unstructured Medical Texts With Conformal Active Learning","abstract":"The extraction of relevant data from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is crucial to identifying symptoms and automating epidemiological surveillance processes. By harnessing the vast amount of unstructured text in EHRs, we can detect patterns that indicate the onset of disease outbreaks, enabling faster, more targeted public health responses. Our proposed framework provides a flexible and efficient solution for mining data from unstructured texts, significantly reducing the need for extensive manual labeling by specialists. Experiments show that our framework achieving strong performance with as few as 200 manually labeled texts, even for complex classification problems. Additionally, our approach can function with simple lightweight models, achieving competitive and occasionally even better results compared to more resource-intensive deep learning models. This capability not only accelerates processing times but also preserves patient privacy, as the data can be processed on weaker on-site hardware rather than being transferred to external systems. Our methodology, therefore, offers a practical, scalable, and privacy-conscious approach to real-time epidemiological monitoring, equipping health institutions to respond rapidly and effectively to emerging health threats."}
{"title":"Assessment of AI-Generated Pediatric Rehabilitation SOAP-Note Quality","abstract":"This study explores the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) or large language models (LLMs) into pediatric rehabilitation clinical documentation, focusing on the generation of SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes, which are essential for patient care. Creating complex documentation is time-consuming in pediatric settings. We evaluate the effectiveness of two AI tools; Copilot, a commercial LLM, and KAUWbot, a fine-tuned LLM developed for KidsAbility Centre for Child Development (an Ontario pediatric rehabilitation facility), in simplifying and automating this process. We focus on two key questions: (i) How does the quality of AI-generated SOAP notes based on short clinician summaries compare to human-authored notes, and (ii) To what extent is human editing necessary for improving AI-generated SOAP notes? We found no evidence of prior work assessing the quality of AI-generated clinical notes in pediatric rehabilitation.\n  We used a sample of 432 SOAP notes, evenly divided among human-authored, Copilot-generated, and KAUWbot-generated notes. We employ a blind evaluation by experienced clinicians based on a custom rubric. Statistical analysis is conducted to assess the quality of the notes and the impact of human editing. The results suggest that AI tools such as KAUWbot and Copilot can generate SOAP notes with quality comparable to those authored by humans. We highlight the potential for combining AI with human expertise to enhance clinical documentation and offer insights for the future integration of AI into pediatric rehabilitation practice and other settings for the management of clinical conditions."}
{"title":"An Agentic AI Workflow for Detecting Cognitive Concerns in Real-world Data","abstract":"Early identification of cognitive concerns is critical but often hindered by subtle symptom presentation. This study developed and validated a fully automated, multi-agent AI workflow using LLaMA 3 8B to identify cognitive concerns in 3,338 clinical notes from Mass General Brigham. The agentic workflow, leveraging task-specific agents that dynamically collaborate to extract meaningful insights from clinical notes, was compared to an expert-driven benchmark. Both workflows achieved high classification performance, with F1-scores of 0.90 and 0.91, respectively. The agentic workflow demonstrated improved specificity (1.00) and achieved prompt refinement in fewer iterations. Although both workflows showed reduced performance on validation data, the agentic workflow maintained perfect specificity. These findings highlight the potential of fully automated multi-agent AI workflows to achieve expert-level accuracy with greater efficiency, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution for detecting cognitive concerns in clinical settings."}
{"title":"Universal Abstraction: Harnessing Frontier Models to Structure Real-World Data at Scale","abstract":"A significant fraction of real-world patient information resides in unstructured clinical text. Medical abstraction extracts and normalizes key structured attributes from free-text clinical notes, which is the prerequisite for a variety of important downstream applications, including registry curation, clinical trial operations, and real-world evidence generation. Prior medical abstraction methods typically resort to building attribute-specific models, each of which requires extensive manual effort such as rule creation or supervised label annotation for the individual attribute, thus limiting scalability. In this paper, we show that existing frontier models already possess the universal abstraction capability for scaling medical abstraction to a wide range of clinical attributes. We present UniMedAbstractor (UMA), a unifying framework for zero-shot medical abstraction with a modular, customizable prompt template and the selection of any frontier large language models. Given a new attribute for abstraction, users only need to conduct lightweight prompt adaptation in UMA to adjust the specification in natural languages. Compared to traditional methods, UMA eliminates the need for attribute-specific training labels or handcrafted rules, thus substantially reducing the development time and cost. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of UMA in oncology using a wide range of marquee attributes representing the cancer patient journey. These include relatively simple attributes typically specified within a single clinical note (e.g. performance status), as well as complex attributes requiring sophisticated reasoning across multiple notes at various time points (e.g. tumor staging). Based on a single frontier model such as GPT-4o, UMA matched or even exceeded the performance of state-of-the-art attribute-specific methods, each of which was tailored to the individual attribute."}
{"title":"CAAT-EHR: Cross-Attentional Autoregressive Transformer for Multimodal Electronic Health Record Embeddings","abstract":"Electronic health records (EHRs) provide a comprehensive source of longitudinal patient data, encompassing structured modalities such as laboratory results, imaging data, and vital signs, and unstructured clinical notes. These datasets, after necessary preprocessing to clean and format the data for analysis, often remain in their raw EHR form, representing numerical or categorical values without further transformation into task-agnostic embeddings. While such raw EHR data enables predictive modeling, its reliance on manual feature engineering or downstream task-specific optimization limits its utility for general-purpose applications. Deep learning (DL) techniques, such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and Transformers, have facilitated predictive tasks like disease progression and diagnosis prediction. However, these methods often struggle to fully exploit the temporal and multimodal dependencies inherent in EHR data due to their reliance on pre-processed but untransformed raw EHR inputs. In this study, we introduce CAAT-EHR, a novel architecture designed to bridge this gap by generating robust, task-agnostic longitudinal embeddings from raw EHR data. CAAT-EHR leverages self- and cross-attention mechanisms in its encoder to integrate temporal and contextual relationships across multiple modalities, transforming the data into enriched embeddings that capture complex dependencies. An autoregressive decoder complements the encoder by predicting future time points data during pre-training, ensuring that the resulting embeddings maintain temporal consistency and alignment. CAAT-EHR eliminates the need for manual feature engineering and enables seamless transferability across diverse downstream tasks. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, demonstrate the superiority of CAAT-EHR-generated embeddings over pre-processed raw EHR data and other baseline approaches."}
{"title":"Large Language Models with Temporal Reasoning for Longitudinal Clinical Summarization and Prediction","abstract":"Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown potential in clinical text summarization, but their ability to handle long patient trajectories with multi-modal data spread across time remains underexplored. This study systematically evaluates several state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, their Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) variants and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting on long-context clinical summarization and prediction. We examine their ability to synthesize structured and unstructured Electronic Health Records (EHR) data while reasoning over temporal coherence, by re-engineering existing tasks, including discharge summarization and diagnosis prediction from two publicly available EHR datasets. Our results indicate that long context windows improve input integration but do not consistently enhance clinical reasoning, and LLMs are still struggling with temporal progression and rare disease prediction. While RAG shows improvements in hallucination in some cases, it does not fully address these limitations. Our work fills the gap in long clinical text summarization, establishing a foundation for evaluating LLMs with multi-modal data and temporal reasoning."}
{"title":"GENIE: Generative Note Information Extraction model for structuring EHR data","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) hold immense potential for advancing healthcare, offering rich, longitudinal data that combines structured information with valuable insights from unstructured clinical notes. However, the unstructured nature of clinical text poses significant challenges for secondary applications. Traditional methods for structuring EHR free-text data, such as rule-based systems and multi-stage pipelines, are often limited by their time-consuming configurations and inability to adapt across clinical notes from diverse healthcare settings. Few systems provide a comprehensive attribute extraction for terminologies. While giant large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and LLaMA 405B excel at structuring tasks, they are slow, costly, and impractical for large-scale use. To overcome these limitations, we introduce GENIE, a Generative Note Information Extraction system that leverages LLMs to streamline the structuring of unstructured clinical text into usable data with standardized format. GENIE processes entire paragraphs in a single pass, extracting entities, assertion statuses, locations, modifiers, values, and purposes with high accuracy. Its unified, end-to-end approach simplifies workflows, reduces errors, and eliminates the need for extensive manual intervention. Using a robust data preparation pipeline and fine-tuned small scale LLMs, GENIE achieves competitive performance across multiple information extraction tasks, outperforming traditional tools like cTAKES and MetaMap and can handle extra attributes to be extracted. GENIE strongly enhances real-world applicability and scalability in healthcare systems. By open-sourcing the model and test data, we aim to encourage collaboration and drive further advancements in EHR structurization."}
{"title":"Continually Evolved Multimodal Foundation Models for Cancer Prognosis","abstract":"Cancer prognosis is a critical task that involves predicting patient outcomes and survival rates. To enhance prediction accuracy, previous studies have integrated diverse data modalities, such as clinical notes, medical images, and genomic data, leveraging their complementary information. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. First, they struggle to incorporate newly arrived data with varying distributions into training, such as patient records from different hospitals, thus rendering sub-optimal generalizability and limited utility in real-world applications. Second, most multimodal integration methods rely on simplistic concatenation or task-specific pipelines, which fail to capture the complex interdependencies across modalities. To address these, we propose a continually evolving multi-modal foundation model. Extensive experiments on the TCGA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to advance cancer prognosis by enabling robust and adaptive multimodal integration."}
{"title":"An Estimator-Robust Design for Augmenting Randomized Controlled Trial with External Real-World Data","abstract":"Augmenting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with external real-world data (RWD) has the potential to improve the finite sample efficiency of treatment effect estimators. We describe using adaptive targeted maximum likelihood estimation (A-TMLE) for estimating the average treatment effect (ATE) by decomposing the ATE estimand into two components: a pooled-ATE estimand that combines data from both the RCT and external sources, and a bias estimand that captures the conditional effect of RCT enrollment on the outcome. This approach views the RCT data as the reference and corrects for inconsistencies of any kind between the RCT and the external data source. Given the growing abundance of external RWD from modern electronic health records, determining the optimal strategy to select candidate external patients for data integration remains an open yet critical problem. In this work, we begin by analyzing the robustness property of the A-TMLE estimator and then propose a matching-based sampling strategy that improves the robustness of the estimator with respect to the target estimand. Our proposed strategy is outcome-blind and involves matching based on two one-dimensional scores: the trial enrollment score and the propensity score in the external data. We demonstrate in simulations that our sampling strategy improves the coverage and shortens the widths of confidence intervals produced by A-TMLE. We illustrate our method with a case study of augmenting the DEVOTE cardiovascular safety trial by using the Optum Clinformatics claims database."}
{"title":"LLM Assistance for Pediatric Depression","abstract":"Traditional depression screening methods, such as the PHQ-9, are particularly challenging for children in pediatric primary care due to practical limitations. AI has the potential to help, but the scarcity of annotated datasets in mental health, combined with the computational costs of training, highlights the need for efficient, zero-shot approaches. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of state-of-the-art LLMs for depressive symptom extraction in pediatric settings (ages 6-24). This approach aims to complement traditional screening and minimize diagnostic errors.\n  Our findings show that all LLMs are 60% more efficient than word match, with Flan leading in precision (average F1: 0.65, precision: 0.78), excelling in the extraction of more rare symptoms like \"sleep problems\" (F1: 0.92) and \"self-loathing\" (F1: 0.8). Phi strikes a balance between precision (0.44) and recall (0.60), performing well in categories like \"Feeling depressed\" (0.69) and \"Weight change\" (0.78). Llama 3, with the highest recall (0.90), overgeneralizes symptoms, making it less suitable for this type of analysis. Challenges include the complexity of clinical notes and overgeneralization from PHQ-9 scores. The main challenges faced by LLMs include navigating the complex structure of clinical notes with content from different times in the patient trajectory, as well as misinterpreting elevated PHQ-9 scores.\n  We finally demonstrate the utility of symptom annotations provided by Flan as features in an ML algorithm, which differentiates depression cases from controls with high precision of 0.78, showing a major performance boost compared to a baseline that does not use these features."}

VeriFact is an artificial intelligence system that combines retrieval-augmented generation and LLM-as-a-Judge to verify whether LLM-generated text is factually supported by a patient's medical history based on their electronic health record (EHR). To evaluate this system, we introduce VeriFact-BHC, a new dataset that decomposes Brief Hospital Course narratives from discharge summaries into a set of simple statements with clinician annotations for whether each statement is supported by the patient's EHR clinical notes. Whereas highest agreement between clinicians was 88.5%, VeriFact achieves up to 92.7% agreement when compared to a denoised and adjudicated average human clinican ground truth, suggesting that VeriFact exceeds the average clinician's ability to fact-check text against a patient's medical record. VeriFact may accelerate the development of LLM-based EHR applications by removing current evaluation bottlenecks."}

Most existing models are static and fail to capture temporal trends in disease progression, limiting their ability to inform timely interventions. We address this gap by developing a dynamic model that leverages common longitudinal clinical indicators from real-world Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for real-time kidney failure prediction.\n  Findings: A retrospective cohort of 4,587 patients from Yinzhou, China, was used for model development (2,752 patients for training, 917 patients for validation) and internal validation (918 patients), while external validation was conducted on a prospective PKUFH cohort (934 patients). The model demonstrated competitive performance across datasets, with an AUROC of 0.9311 (95%CI, 0.8873-0.9749) in the internal validation cohort and 0.8141 (95%CI, 0.7728-0.8554) in the external validation cohort, alongside progressively improving dynamic predictions, good calibration, and clinically consistent interpretability. KFDeep has been deployed on an open-access website and in primary care settings.\n  Interpretation: The KFDeep model enables dynamic prediction of kidney failure without increasing clinical examination costs. It has been integrated into existing hospital systems, providing physicians with a continuously updated decision-support tool in routine care."}
{"title":"Salvaging Forbidden Treasure in Medical Data: Utilizing Surrogate Outcomes and Single Records for Rare Event Modeling","abstract":"The vast repositories of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and medical claims hold untapped potential for studying rare but critical events, such as suicide attempt. Conventional setups often model suicide attempt as a univariate outcome and also exclude any ``single-record'' patients with a single documented encounter due to a lack of historical information. However, patients who were diagnosed with suicide attempts at the only encounter could, to some surprise, represent a substantial proportion of all attempt cases in the data, as high as 70--80%. We innovate a hybrid and integrative learning framework to leverage concurrent outcomes as surrogates and harness the forbidden yet precious information from single-record data. Our approach employs a supervised learning component to learn the latent variables that connect primary (e.g., suicide) and surrogate outcomes (e.g., mental disorders) to historical information. It simultaneously employs an unsupervised learning component to utilize the single-record data, through the shared latent variables. As such, our approach offers a general strategy for information integration that is crucial to modeling rare conditions and events. With hospital inpatient data from Connecticut, we demonstrate that single-record data and concurrent diagnoses indeed carry valuable information, and utilizing them can substantially improve suicide risk modeling."}

While Social Determinants of Health (SDOH) such as socioeconomic status and housing stability play critical roles in health outcomes, they are often underrepresented in structured EHRs and hidden in unstructured clinical notes. This study leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to extract SDOHs from clinical text and uses logistic regression to analyze their association with HF readmissions. By identifying key SDOHs (e.g. tobacco usage, limited transportation) linked to readmission risk, this work also offers actionable insights for reducing readmissions and improving patient care."}
{"title":"MedSlice: Fine-Tuned Large Language Models for Secure Clinical Note Sectioning","abstract":"Extracting sections from clinical notes is crucial for downstream analysis but is challenging due to variability in formatting and labor-intensive nature of manual sectioning. While proprietary large language models (LLMs) have shown promise, privacy concerns limit their accessibility. This study develops a pipeline for automated note sectioning using open-source LLMs, focusing on three sections: History of Present Illness, Interval History, and Assessment and Plan. We fine-tuned three open-source LLMs to extract sections using a curated dataset of 487 progress notes, comparing results relative to proprietary models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini). Internal and external validity were assessed via precision, recall and F1 score. Fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B outperformed GPT-4o (F1=0.92). On the external validity test set, performance remained high (F1= 0.85). Fine-tuned open-source LLMs can surpass proprietary models in clinical note sectioning, offering advantages in cost, performance, and accessibility."}
{"title":"Question Answering on Patient Medical Records with Private Fine-Tuned LLMs","abstract":"Healthcare systems continuously generate vast amounts of electronic health records (EHRs), commonly stored in the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard. Despite the wealth of information in these records, their complexity and volume make it difficult for users to retrieve and interpret crucial health insights. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a solution, enabling semantic question answering (QA) over medical data, allowing users to interact with their health records more effectively. However, ensuring privacy and compliance requires edge and private deployments of LLMs.\n  This paper proposes a novel approach to semantic QA over EHRs by first identifying the most relevant FHIR resources for a user query (Task1) and subsequently answering the query based on these resources (Task2). We explore the performance of privately hosted, fine-tuned LLMs, evaluating them against benchmark models such as GPT-4 and GPT-4o. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs, while 250x smaller in size, outperform GPT-4 family models by 0.55% in F1 score on Task1 and 42% on Meteor Task in Task2. Additionally, we examine advanced aspects of LLM usage, including sequential fine-tuning, model self-evaluation (narcissistic evaluation), and the impact of training data size on performance.

{"title":"Unveiling Discrete Clues: Superior Healthcare Predictions for Rare Diseases","abstract":"Accurate healthcare prediction is essential for improving patient outcomes. Existing work primarily leverages advanced frameworks like attention or graph networks to capture the intricate collaborative (CO) signals in electronic health records. However, prediction for rare diseases remains challenging due to limited co-occurrence and inadequately tailored approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes UDC, a novel method that unveils discrete clues to bridge consistent textual knowledge and CO signals within a unified semantic space, thereby enriching the representation semantics of rare diseases. Specifically, we focus on addressing two key sub-problems: (1) acquiring distinguishable discrete encodings for precise disease representation and (2) achieving semantic alignment between textual knowledge and the CO signals at the code level. For the first sub-problem, we refine the standard vector quantized process to include condition awareness. Additionally, we develop an advanced contrastive approach in the decoding stage, leveraging synthetic and mixed-domain targets as hard negatives to enrich the perceptibility of the reconstructed representation for downstream tasks. For the second sub-problem, we introduce a novel codebook update strategy using co-teacher distillation. This approach facilitates bidirectional supervision between textual knowledge and CO signals, thereby aligning semantically equivalent information in a shared discrete latent space. Extensive experiments on three datasets demonstrate our superiority."}
{"title":"Multimodal AI on Wound Images and Clinical Notes for Home Patient Referral","abstract":"Chronic wounds affect 8.5 million Americans, particularly the elderly and patients with diabetes. These wounds can take up to nine months to heal, making regular care essential to ensure healing and prevent severe outcomes like limb amputations. Many patients receive care at home from visiting nurses with varying levels of wound expertise, leading to inconsistent care. Problematic, non-healing wounds should be referred to wound specialists, but referral decisions in non-clinical settings are often erroneous, delayed, or unnecessary.\n  This paper introduces the Deep Multimodal Wound Assessment Tool (DM-WAT), a machine learning framework designed to assist visiting nurses in deciding whether to refer chronic wound patients. DM-WAT analyzes smartphone-captured wound images and clinical notes from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). It uses DeiT-Base-Distilled, a Vision Transformer (ViT), to extract visual features from images and DeBERTa-base to extract text features from clinical notes. DM-WAT combines visual and text features using an intermediate fusion approach. To address challenges posed by a small and imbalanced dataset, it integrates image and text augmentation with transfer learning to achieve high performance. In evaluations, DM-WAT achieved 77% with std 3% accuracy and a 70% with std 2% F1 score, outperforming prior approaches. Score-CAM and Captum interpretation algorithms provide insights into specific parts of image and text inputs that influence recommendations, enhancing interpretability and trust."}
{"title":"Embedding-Driven Diversity Sampling to Improve Few-Shot Synthetic Data Generation","abstract":"Accurate classification of clinical text often requires fine-tuning pre-trained language models, a process that is costly and time-consuming due to the need for high-quality data and expert annotators. Synthetic data generation offers an alternative, though pre-trained models may not capture the syntactic diversity of clinical notes. We propose an embedding-driven approach that uses diversity sampling from a small set of real clinical notes to guide large language models in few-shot prompting, generating synthetic text that better reflects clinical syntax. We evaluated this method using the CheXpert dataset on a classification task, comparing it to random few-shot and zero-shot approaches. Using cosine similarity and a Turing test, our approach produced synthetic notes that more closely align with real clinical text. Our pipeline reduced the data needed to reach the 0.85 AUC cutoff by 40% for AUROC and 30% for AUPRC, while augmenting models with synthetic data improved AUROC by 57% and AUPRC by 68%. Additionally, our synthetic data was 0.9 times as effective as real data, a 60% improvement in value."}
{"title":"DeepIFSAC: Deep Imputation of Missing Values Using Feature and Sample Attention within Contrastive Framework","abstract":"Missing values of varying patterns and rates in real-world tabular data pose a significant challenge in developing reliable data-driven models. The most commonly used statistical and machine learning methods for missing value imputation may be ineffective when the missing rate is high and not random. This paper explores row and column attention in tabular data as between-feature and between-sample attention in a novel framework to reconstruct missing values. The proposed method uses CutMix data augmentation within a contrastive learning framework to improve the uncertainty of missing value estimation. The performance and generalizability of trained imputation models are evaluated in set-aside test data folds with missing values. The proposed framework is compared with 11 state-of-the-art statistical, machine learning, and deep imputation methods using 12 diverse tabular data sets. The average performance rank of our proposed method demonstrates its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods for missing rates between 10% and 90% and three missing value types, especially when the missing values are not random. The quality of the imputed data using our proposed method is compared in a downstream patient classification task using real-world electronic health records. This paper highlights the heterogeneity of tabular data sets to recommend imputation methods based on missing value types and data characteristics."}
{"title":"Challenges and recommendations for Electronic Health Records data extraction and preparation for dynamic prediction modelling in hospitalized patients -- a practical guide","abstract":"Dynamic predictive modelling using electronic health record (EHR) data has gained significant attention in recent years. The reliability and trustworthiness of such models depend heavily on the quality of the underlying data, which is, in part, determined by the stages preceding the model development: data extraction from EHR systems and data preparation. In this article, we identified over forty challenges encountered during these stages and provide actionable recommendations for addressing them. These challenges are organized into four categories: cohort definition, outcome definition, feature engineering, and data cleaning. This comprehensive list serves as a practical guide for data extraction engineers and researchers, promoting best practices and improving the quality and real-world applicability of dynamic prediction models in clinical settings."}
{"title":"Electronic Health Records: Towards Digital Twins in Healthcare","abstract":"The pivotal shift from traditional paper-based records to sophisticated Electronic Health Records (EHR), enabled systematic collection and analysis of patient data through descriptive statistics, providing insight into patterns and trends across patient populations. This evolution continued toward predictive analytics, allowing healthcare providers to anticipate patient outcomes and potential complications before they occur. This progression from basic digital record-keeping to sophisticated predictive modelling and digital twins reflects healthcare's broader evolution toward more integrated, patient-centred approaches that combine data-driven insights with personalized care delivery. This chapter explores the evolution and significance of healthcare information systems, beginning with an examination of the implementation of EHR in the UK and the USA. It provides a comprehensive overview of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) system, tracing its development from ICD-9 to ICD-10. Central to this discussion is the MIMIC-III database, a landmark achievement in healthcare data sharing and arguably the most comprehensive critical care database freely available to researchers worldwide. MIMIC-III has democratized access to high-quality healthcare data, enabling unprecedented opportunities for research and analysis. The chapter examines its structure, clinical outcome analysis capabilities, and practical applications through case studies, with a particular focus on mortality and length of stay metrics, vital signs extraction, and ICD coding. Through detailed entity-relationship diagrams and practical examples, the text illustrates MIMIC's complex data structure and demonstrates how different querying approaches can lead to subtly different results, emphasizing the critical importance of understanding the database's architecture for accurate data extraction."}
{"title":"Evaluating LLM Abilities to Understand Tabular Electronic Health Records: A Comprehensive Study of Patient Data Extraction and Retrieval","abstract":"Electronic Health Record (EHR) tables pose unique challenges among which is the presence of hidden contextual dependencies between medical features with a high level of data dimensionality and sparsity. This study presents the first investigation into the abilities of LLMs to comprehend EHRs for patient data extraction and retrieval. We conduct extensive experiments using the MIMICSQL dataset to explore the impact of the prompt structure, instruction, context, and demonstration, of two backbone LLMs, Llama2 and Meditron, based on task performance. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, our findings show that optimal feature selection and serialization methods can enhance task performance by up to 26.79% compared to naive approaches. Similarly, in-context learning setups with relevant example selection improve data extraction performance by 5.95%. Based on our study findings, we propose guidelines that we believe would help the design of LLM-based models to support health search."}
{"title":"Development and Validation of the Provider Documentation Summarization Quality Instrument for Large Language Models","abstract":"As Large Language Models (LLMs) are integrated into electronic health record (EHR) workflows, validated instruments are essential to evaluate their performance before implementation. Existing instruments for provider documentation quality are often unsuitable for the complexities of LLM-generated text and lack validation on real-world data. The Provider Documentation Summarization Quality Instrument (PDSQI-9) was developed to evaluate LLM-generated clinical summaries. Multi-document summaries were generated from real-world EHR data across multiple specialties using several LLMs (GPT-4o, Mixtral 8x7b, and Llama 3-8b). Validation included Pearson correlation for substantive validity, factor analysis and Cronbach's alpha for structural validity, inter-rater reliability (ICC and Krippendorff's alpha) for generalizability, a semi-Delphi process for content validity, and comparisons of high-versus low-quality summaries for discriminant validity. Seven physician raters evaluated 779 summaries and answered 8,329 questions, achieving over 80% power for inter-rater reliability. The PDSQI-9 demonstrated strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.879; 95% CI: 0.867-0.891) and high inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.867; 95% CI: 0.867-0.868), supporting structural validity and generalizability. Factor analysis identified a 4-factor model explaining 58% of the variance, representing organization, clarity, accuracy, and utility. Substantive validity was supported by correlations between note length and scores for Succinct (rho = -0.200, p = 0.029) and Organized ($\u03c1= -0.190$, $p = 0.037$). Discriminant validity distinguished high- from low-quality summaries ($p < 0.001$). The PDSQI-9 demonstrates robust construct validity, supporting its use in clinical practice to evaluate LLM-generated summaries and facilitate safer integration of LLMs into healthcare workflows."}
{"title":"Investigating Primary Care Indications to Improve Electronic Health Record in Dementia Target Trial Emulation","abstract":"Missing data, inaccuracies in medication lists, and recording delays in electronic health records (EHR) are major limitations for target trial emulation (TTE), the process by which EHR data are used to retrospectively emulate a randomized control trial. EHR TTE relies on recorded data that proxy true drug exposures and outcomes. We investigate the under-utilized criterion that a patient has indications of primary care provider (PCP) encounters within the EHR. Such patients tend to have more records overall and a greater proportion of the types of encounters that materialize comprehensive and up-to-date records. We examine the impact of including a PCP feature in the TTE model or as an eligibility criterion for cohort selection, contrasted with ignoring it altogether. To that end, we compare the estimated effects of two first line antidiabetic drug classes on the onset of Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). We find that the estimated treatment effect is sensitive to the consideration of a PCP feature, particularly when used as an eligibility criterion. Our work suggests that this PCP feature should be further researched."}
{"title":"Subtype-Aware Registration of Longitudinal Electronic Health Records","abstract":"Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain extensive patient information that can inform downstream clinical decisions, such as mortality prediction, disease phenotyping, and disease onset prediction. A key challenge in EHR data analysis is the temporal gap between when a condition is first recorded and its actual onset time. Such timeline misalignment can lead to artificially distinct biomarker trends among patients with similar disease progression, undermining the reliability of downstream analysis and complicating tasks like disease subtyping. To address this challenge, we provide a subtype-aware timeline registration method that leverages data projection and discrete optimization to simultaneously correct timeline misalignment and improve disease subtyping. Through simulation and real-world data analyses, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively aligns distorted observed records with the true disease progression patterns, enhancing subtyping clarity and improving performance in downstream clinical analyses."}
{"title":"A data-driven approach to discover and quantify systemic lupus erythematosus etiological heterogeneity from electronic health records","abstract":"Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex heterogeneous disease with many manifestational facets. We propose a data-driven approach to discover probabilistic independent sources from multimodal imperfect EHR data. These sources represent exogenous variables in the data generation process causal graph that estimate latent root causes of the presence of SLE in the health record. We objectively evaluated the sources against the original variables from which they were discovered by training supervised models to discriminate SLE from negative health records using a reduced set of labelled instances. We found 19 predictive sources with high clinical validity and whose EHR signatures define independent factors of SLE heterogeneity. Using the sources as input patient data representation enables models to provide with rich explanations that better capture the clinical reasons why a particular record is (not) an SLE case. Providers may be willing to trade patient-level interpretability for discrimination especially in challenging cases."}
{"title":"Natural Language-Assisted Multi-modal Medication Recommendation","abstract":"Combinatorial medication recommendation(CMR) is a fundamental task of healthcare, which offers opportunities for clinical physicians to provide more precise prescriptions for patients with intricate health conditions, particularly in the scenarios of long-term medical care. Previous research efforts have sought to extract meaningful information from electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate combinatorial medication recommendations. Existing learning-based approaches further consider the chemical structures of medications, but ignore the textual medication descriptions in which the functionalities are clearly described. Furthermore, the textual knowledge derived from the EHRs of patients remains largely underutilized. To address these issues, we introduce the Natural Language-Assisted Multi-modal Medication Recommendation(NLA-MMR), a multi-modal alignment framework designed to learn knowledge from the patient view and medication view jointly. Specifically, NLA-MMR formulates CMR as an alignment problem from patient and medication modalities. In this vein, we employ pretrained language models(PLMs) to extract in-domain knowledge regarding patients and medications, serving as the foundational representation for both modalities. In the medication modality, we exploit both chemical structures and textual descriptions to create medication representations. In the patient modality, we generate the patient representations based on textual descriptions of diagnosis, procedure, and symptom. Extensive experiments conducted on three publicly accessible datasets demonstrate that NLA-MMR achieves new state-of-the-art performance, with a notable average improvement of 4.72% in Jaccard score. Our source code is publicly available on https:\/\/github.com\/jtan1102\/NLA-MMR_CIKM_2024."}
{"title":"MedCT: A Clinical Terminology Graph for Generative AI Applications in Healthcare","abstract":"We introduce the world's first clinical terminology for the Chinese healthcare community, namely MedCT, accompanied by a clinical foundation model MedBERT and an entity linking model MedLink. The MedCT system enables standardized and programmable representation of Chinese clinical data, successively stimulating the development of new medicines, treatment pathways, and better patient outcomes for the populous Chinese community. Moreover, the MedCT knowledge graph provides a principled mechanism to minimize the hallucination problem of large language models (LLMs), therefore achieving significant levels of accuracy and safety in LLM-based clinical applications. By leveraging the LLMs' emergent capabilities of generativeness and expressiveness, we were able to rapidly built a production-quality terminology system and deployed to real-world clinical field within three months, while classical terminologies like SNOMED CT have gone through more than twenty years development. Our experiments show that the MedCT system achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in semantic matching and entity linking tasks, not only for Chinese but also for English. We also conducted a longitudinal field experiment by applying MedCT and LLMs in a representative spectrum of clinical tasks, including electronic health record (EHR) auto-generation and medical document search for diagnostic decision making. Our study shows a multitude of values of MedCT for clinical workflows and patient outcomes, especially in the new genre of clinical LLM applications. We present our approach in sufficient engineering detail, such that implementing a clinical terminology for other non-English societies should be readily reproducible. We openly release our terminology, models and algorithms, along with real-world clinical datasets for the development."}
{"title":"TAMER: A Test-Time Adaptive MoE-Driven Framework for EHR Representation Learning","abstract":"We propose TAMER, a Test-time Adaptive MoE-driven framework for Electronic Health Record (EHR) Representation learning. TAMER introduces a framework where a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture is co-designed with Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) to jointly mitigate the intertwined challenges of patient heterogeneity and distribution shifts in EHR modeling. The MoE focuses on latent patient subgroups through domain-aware expert specialization, while TTA enables real-time adaptation to evolving health status distributions when new patient samples are introduced. Extensive experiments across four real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that TAMER consistently improves predictive performance for both mortality and readmission risk tasks when combined with diverse EHR modeling backbones. TAMER offers a promising approach for dynamic and personalized EHR-based predictions in practical clinical settings."}
{"title":"Towards accurate and reliable ICU outcome prediction: a multimodal learning framework based on belief function theory using structured EHRs and free-text notes","abstract":"Accurate Intensive Care Unit (ICU) outcome prediction is critical for improving patient treatment quality and ICU resource allocation. Existing research mainly focuses on structured data, e.g. demographics and vital signs, and lacks effective frameworks to integrate clinical notes from heterogeneous electronic health records (EHRs). This study aims to explore a multimodal framework based on belief function theory that can effectively fuse heterogeneous structured EHRs and free-text notes for accurate and reliable ICU outcome prediction. The fusion strategy accounts for prediction uncertainty within each modality and conflicts between multimodal data. The experiments on MIMIC-III dataset show that our framework provides more accurate and reliable predictions than existing approaches. Specifically, it outperformed the best baseline by 1.05%\/1.02% in BACC, 9.74%\/6.04% in F1 score, 1.28%\/0.9% in AUROC, and 6.21%\/2.68% in AUPRC for predicting mortality and PLOS, respectively. Additionally, it improved the reliability of the predictions with a 26.8%\/15.1% reduction in the Brier score and a 25.0%\/13.3% reduction in negative log-likelihood. By effectively reducing false positives, the model can aid in better allocation of medical resources in the ICU. Furthermore, the proposed method is very versatile and can be extended to analyzing multimodal EHRs for other clinical tasks.

{"title":"Representation Learning of Lab Values via Masked AutoEncoders","abstract":"Accurate imputation of missing laboratory values in electronic health records (EHRs) is critical to enable robust clinical predictions and reduce biases in AI systems in healthcare. Existing methods, such as XGBoost, softimpute, GAIN, Expectation Maximization (EM), and MICE, struggle to model the complex temporal and contextual dependencies in EHR data, particularly in underrepresented groups. In this work, we propose Lab-MAE, a novel transformer-based masked autoencoder framework that leverages self-supervised learning for the imputation of continuous sequential lab values. Lab-MAE introduces a structured encoding scheme that jointly models laboratory test values and their corresponding timestamps, enabling explicit capturing temporal dependencies. Empirical evaluation on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrates that Lab-MAE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines such as XGBoost, softimpute, GAIN, EM, and MICE across multiple metrics, including root mean square error (RMSE), R-squared (R2), and Wasserstein distance (WD). Notably, Lab-MAE achieves equitable performance across demographic groups of patients, advancing fairness in clinical predictions. We further investigate the role of follow-up laboratory values as potential shortcut features, revealing Lab-MAE's robustness in scenarios where such data is unavailable. The findings suggest that our transformer-based architecture, adapted to the characteristics of EHR data, offers a foundation model for more accurate and fair clinical imputation. In addition, we measure and compare the carbon footprint of Lab-MAE with the a XGBoost model, highlighting its environmental requirements."}
{"title":"Advancing Pancreatic Cancer Prediction with a Next Visit Token Prediction Head on top of Med-BERT","abstract":"Background: Recently, numerous foundation models pretrained on extensive data have demonstrated efficacy in disease prediction using Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, there remains some unanswered questions on how to best utilize such models especially with very small fine-tuning cohorts. Methods: We utilized Med-BERT, an EHR-specific foundation model, and reformulated the disease binary prediction task into a token prediction task and a next visit mask token prediction task to align with Med-BERT's pretraining task format in order to improve the accuracy of pancreatic cancer (PaCa) prediction in both few-shot and fully supervised settings. Results: The reformulation of the task into a token prediction task, referred to as Med-BERT-Sum, demonstrates slightly superior performance in both few-shot scenarios and larger data samples. Furthermore, reformulating the prediction task as a Next Visit Mask Token Prediction task (Med-BERT-Mask) significantly outperforms the conventional Binary Classification (BC) prediction task (Med-BERT-BC) by 3% to 7% in few-shot scenarios with data sizes ranging from 10 to 500 samples. These findings highlight that aligning the downstream task with Med-BERT's pretraining objectives substantially enhances the model's predictive capabilities, thereby improving its effectiveness in predicting both rare and common diseases. Conclusion: Reformatting disease prediction tasks to align with the pretraining of foundation models enhances prediction accuracy, leading to earlier detection and timely intervention. This approach improves treatment effectiveness, survival rates, and overall patient outcomes for PaCa and potentially other cancers."}
{"title":"Denoising Diffused Embeddings: a Generative Approach for Hypergraphs","abstract":"Hypergraph data, which capture multi-way interactions among entities, are becoming increasingly prevalent in the big data eta. Generating new hyperlinks from an observed, usually high-dimensional hypergraph is an important yet challenging task with diverse applications, such as electronic health record analysis and biological research. This task is fraught with several challenges. The discrete nature of hyperlinks renders many existing generative models inapplicable. Additionally, powerful machine learning-based generative models often operate as black boxes, providing limited interpretability. Key structural characteristics of hypergraphs, including node degree heterogeneity and hyperlink sparsity, further complicate the modeling process and must be carefully addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose Denoising Diffused Embeddings (DDE), a general generative model architecture for hypergraphs. DDE exploits potential low-rank structures in high-dimensional hypergraphs and adopts the state-of-the-art diffusion model framework. Theoretically, we show that when true embeddings are accessible, DDE exactly reduces the task of generating new high-dimensional hyperlinks to generating new low-dimensional embeddings. Moreover, we analyze the implications of using estimated embeddings in DDE, revealing how hypergraph properties--such as dimensionality, node degree heterogeneity, and hyperlink sparsity--impact its generative performance. Simulation studies demonstrate the superiority of DDE over existing methods, in terms of both computational efficiency and generative accuracy. Furthermore, an application to a symptom co-occurrence hypergraph derived from electronic medical records uncovers interesting findings and highlights the advantages of DDE."}
{"title":"Efficient Standardization of Clinical Notes using Large Language Models","abstract":"Clinician notes are a rich source of patient information but often contain inconsistencies due to varied writing styles, colloquialisms, abbreviations, medical jargon, grammatical errors, and non-standard formatting. These inconsistencies hinder the extraction of meaningful data from electronic health records (EHRs), posing challenges for quality improvement, population health, precision medicine, decision support, and research.\n  We present a large language model approach to standardizing a corpus of 1,618 clinical notes. Standardization corrected an average of $4.9 +\/- 1.8$ grammatical errors, $3.3 +\/- 5.2$ spelling errors, converted $3.1 +\/- 3.0$ non-standard terms to standard terminology, and expanded $15.8 +\/- 9.1$ abbreviations and acronyms per note. Additionally, notes were re-organized into canonical sections with standardized headings. This process prepared notes for key concept extraction, mapping to medical ontologies, and conversion to interoperable data formats such as FHIR.\n  Expert review of randomly sampled notes found no significant data loss after standardization. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that standardization of clinical notes can improve their readability, consistency, and usability, while also facilitating their conversion into interoperable data formats."}
{"title":"SepsisCalc: Integrating Clinical Calculators into Early Sepsis Prediction via Dynamic Temporal Graph Construction","abstract":"Sepsis is an organ dysfunction caused by a deregulated immune response to an infection. Early sepsis prediction and identification allow for timely intervention, leading to improved clinical outcomes. Clinical calculators (e.g., the six-organ dysfunction assessment of SOFA) play a vital role in sepsis identification within clinicians' workflow, providing evidence-based risk assessments essential for sepsis diagnosis. However, artificial intelligence (AI) sepsis prediction models typically generate a single sepsis risk score without incorporating clinical calculators for assessing organ dysfunctions, making the models less convincing and transparent to clinicians. To bridge the gap, we propose to mimic clinicians' workflow with a novel framework SepsisCalc to integrate clinical calculators into the predictive model, yielding a clinically transparent and precise model for utilization in clinical settings. Practically, clinical calculators usually combine information from multiple component variables in Electronic Health Records (EHR), and might not be applicable when the variables are (partially) missing. We mitigate this issue by representing EHRs as temporal graphs and integrating a learning module to dynamically add the accurately estimated calculator to the graphs. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on sepsis prediction tasks. Moreover, we developed a system to identify organ dysfunctions and potential sepsis risks, providing a human-AI interaction tool for deployment, which can help clinicians understand the prediction outputs and prepare timely interventions for the corresponding dysfunctions, paving the way for actionable clinical decision-making support for early intervention."}
{"title":"LEARNER: A Transfer Learning Method for Low-Rank Matrix Estimation","abstract":"Low-rank matrix estimation is a fundamental problem in statistics and machine learning with applications across biomedical sciences, including genetics, medical imaging, drug discovery, and electronic health record data analysis. In the context of heterogeneous data generated from diverse sources, a key challenge lies in leveraging data from a source population to enhance the estimation of a low-rank matrix in a target population of interest. We propose an approach that leverages similarity in the latent row and column spaces between the source and target populations to improve estimation in the target population, which we refer to as LatEnt spAce-based tRaNsfer lEaRning (LEARNER). LEARNER is based on performing a low-rank approximation of the target population data which penalizes differences between the latent row and column spaces between the source and target populations. We present a cross-validation approach that allows the method to adapt to the degree of heterogeneity across populations. We conducted extensive simulations which found that LEARNER often outperforms the benchmark approach that only uses the target population data, especially as the signal-to-noise ratio in the source population increases. We also performed an illustrative application and empirical comparison of LEARNER and benchmark approaches in a re-analysis of summary statistics from a genome-wide association study in the BioBank Japan cohort. LEARNER is implemented in the R package learner and the Python package learner-py."}
{"title":"MEDEC: A Benchmark for Medical Error Detection and Correction in Clinical Notes","abstract":"Several studies showed that Large Language Models (LLMs) can answer medical questions correctly, even outperforming the average human score in some medical exams. However, to our knowledge, no study has been conducted to assess the ability of language models to validate existing or generated medical text for correctness and consistency. In this paper, we introduce MEDEC (https:\/\/github.com\/abachaa\/MEDEC), the first publicly available benchmark for medical error detection and correction in clinical notes, covering five types of errors (Diagnosis, Management, Treatment, Pharmacotherapy, and Causal Organism). MEDEC consists of 3,848 clinical texts, including 488 clinical notes from three US hospital systems that were not previously seen by any LLM. The dataset has been used for the MEDIQA-CORR shared task to evaluate seventeen participating systems [Ben Abacha et al., 2024]. In this paper, we describe the data creation methods and we evaluate recent LLMs (e.g., o1-preview, GPT-4, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 2.0 Flash) for the tasks of detecting and correcting medical errors requiring both medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities. We also conducted a comparative study where two medical doctors performed the same task on the MEDEC test set. The results showed that MEDEC is a sufficiently challenging benchmark to assess the ability of models to validate existing or generated notes and to correct medical errors. We also found that although recent LLMs have a good performance in error detection and correction, they are still outperformed by medical doctors in these tasks. We discuss the potential factors behind this gap, the insights from our experiments, the limitations of current evaluation metrics, and share potential pointers for future research."}
{"title":"SurvAttack: Black-Box Attack On Survival Models through Ontology-Informed EHR Perturbation","abstract":"Survival analysis (SA) models have been widely studied in mining electronic health records (EHRs), particularly in forecasting the risk of critical conditions for prioritizing high-risk patients. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks is much less explored in the literature. Developing black-box perturbation algorithms and evaluating their impact on state-of-the-art survival models brings two benefits to medical applications. First, it can effectively evaluate the robustness of models in pre-deployment testing. Also, exploring how subtle perturbations would result in significantly different outcomes can provide counterfactual insights into the clinical interpretation of model prediction. In this work, we introduce SurvAttack, a novel black-box adversarial attack framework leveraging subtle clinically compatible, and semantically consistent perturbations on longitudinal EHRs to degrade survival models' predictive performance. We specifically develop a greedy algorithm to manipulate medical codes with various adversarial actions throughout a patient's medical history. Then, these adversarial actions are prioritized using a composite scoring strategy based on multi-aspect perturbation quality, including saliency, perturbation stealthiness, and clinical meaningfulness. The proposed adversarial EHR perturbation algorithm is then used in an efficient SA-specific strategy to attack a survival model when estimating the temporal ranking of survival urgency for patients. To demonstrate the significance of our work, we conduct extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons, explainability analysis, and case studies. The experimental results affirm our research's effectiveness in illustrating the vulnerabilities of patient survival models, model interpretation, and ultimately contributing to healthcare quality."}
{"title":"Aligning AI Research with the Needs of Clinical Coding Workflows: Eight Recommendations Based on US Data Analysis and Critical Review","abstract":"Clinical coding is crucial for healthcare billing and data analysis. Manual clinical coding is labour-intensive and error-prone, which has motivated research towards full automation of the process. However, our analysis, based on US English electronic health records and automated coding research using these records, shows that widely used evaluation methods are not aligned with real clinical contexts. For example, evaluations that focus on the top 50 most common codes are an oversimplification, as there are thousands of codes used in practice. This position paper aims to align AI coding research more closely with practical challenges of clinical coding. Based on our analysis, we offer eight specific recommendations, suggesting ways to improve current evaluation methods. Additionally, we propose new AI-based methods beyond automated coding, suggesting alternative approaches to assist clinical coders in their workflows."}

{"title":"Distilling Large Language Models for Efficient Clinical Information Extraction","abstract":"Large language models (LLMs) excel at clinical information extraction but their computational demands limit practical deployment. Knowledge distillation--the process of transferring knowledge from larger to smaller models--offers a potential solution. We evaluate the performance of distilled BERT models, which are approximately 1,000 times smaller than modern LLMs, for clinical named entity recognition (NER) tasks. We leveraged state-of-the-art LLMs (Gemini and OpenAI models) and medical ontologies (RxNorm and SNOMED) as teacher labelers for medication, disease, and symptom extraction. We applied our approach to over 3,300 clinical notes spanning five publicly available datasets, comparing distilled BERT models against both their teacher labelers and BERT models fine-tuned on human labels. External validation was conducted using clinical notes from the MedAlign dataset. For disease extraction, F1 scores were 0.82 (teacher model), 0.89 (BioBERT trained on human labels), and 0.84 (BioBERT-distilled). For medication, F1 scores were 0.84 (teacher model), 0.91 (BioBERT-human), and 0.87 (BioBERT-distilled). For symptoms: F1 score of 0.73 (teacher model) and 0.68 (BioBERT-distilled). Distilled BERT models had faster inference (12x, 4x, 8x faster than GPT-4o, o1-mini, and Gemini Flash respectively) and lower costs (85x, 101x, 2x cheaper than GPT-4o, o1-mini, and Gemini Flash respectively). On the external validation dataset, the distilled BERT model achieved F1 scores of 0.883 (medication), 0.726 (disease), and 0.699 (symptom). Distilled BERT models were up to 101x cheaper and 12x faster than state-of-the-art LLMs while achieving similar performance on NER tasks. Distillation offers a computationally efficient and scalable alternative to large LLMs for clinical information extraction."}
{"title":"Assessing treatment effects in observational data with missing confounders: A comparative study of practical doubly-robust and traditional missing data methods","abstract":"In pharmacoepidemiology, safety and effectiveness are frequently evaluated using readily available administrative and electronic health records data. In these settings, detailed confounder data are often not available in all data sources and therefore missing on a subset of individuals. Multiple imputation (MI) and inverse-probability weighting (IPW) are go-to analytical methods to handle missing data and are dominant in the biomedical literature. Doubly-robust methods, which are consistent under fewer assumptions, can be more efficient with respect to mean-squared error. We discuss two practical-to-implement doubly-robust estimators, generalized raking and inverse probability-weighted targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE), which are both currently under-utilized in biomedical studies. We compare their performance to IPW and MI in a detailed numerical study for a variety of synthetic data-generating and missingness scenarios, including scenarios with rare outcomes and a high missingness proportion. Further, we consider plasmode simulation studies that emulate the complex data structure of a large electronic health records cohort in order to compare anti-depressant therapies in a rare-outcome setting where a key confounder is prone to more than 50\\% missingness. We provide guidance on selecting a missing data analysis approach, based on which methods excelled with respect to the bias-variance trade-off across the different scenarios studied."}
